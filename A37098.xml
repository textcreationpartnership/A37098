            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The vaſt Globe of the Earth (according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi> upon which the Magnetic Philoſophy is, or ſeems to be founded, is in perpetual motion, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all viſible Creatures which have their <hi>Oecema</hi> or habitacle here, ſeem alſo ſubject to the ſame Inſtability.

Some times it is conſpicuous in one and the ſame Man to be advanced from Poverty to Wealth, promoted from Shame to Honour and elevated from the Dungeon to a Throne, and on an inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed from Riches to Extreme Wants, abaſed from the higheſt pitch of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the ſink of Diſhonour and reduced from the Scepter and Chair of State to the Oar and Galley. Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was that Change of <hi>C.

            <p>VVHen Triumphant <hi>Holland</hi> like the victorious <hi>Tritonia</hi> was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on her pompous Chariot, molded of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Silver by the valorous Enterpriſes of her renowned Admiral <hi>Peter</hi> P. <hi>Heyn;</hi> and her fatal ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ſeemd to give way, and allow her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Temple of Joy: there dwelt in the famous City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> one <hi>Iuſtinus,</hi> a youth, whoſe mind upon the report of this moſt gallant Exploit, and the noiſe of ſuch an invaluable prize ſeem'd to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched out of the bounds of Continency; The univerſal diſplay of an atchievment ſo noble, created in him another frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit, inſomuch that it bereaved him totally of the bleſſed fruition of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his proper vocation; adjudging it too mean a <hi>Medium</hi> to render him a participant of ſo big a Fortune; and an occupation not able to do him the leſt ſervice in the acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ambitious ends: ſo that contrary to the vulgarly known (yet ſolid) Document of <hi>Apelles, Let not the Shoemaker go beyond his Laſt,</hi> he arrives at this Concluſion, That

ſome other courſe muſt be taken whereby he may attain to the ſcope he aim'd at: yet all his Reſolutions were as impracticable, as his End was vain and inacceſſible; to carry it on in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Valour, was a ſphere too ſublime and redious for him to move in, as Theft and Cheating was baſe and perillous; The former difficult, becauſe he was not indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that acuteneſs of a <hi>Genius,</hi> which is requiſite in endeavouring to gain the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of thoſe with whom he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be had in repute; and the Party in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual danger of diſcovery, and the ſequel. Thus the more he conſulted with his Wits, the leſs ſatisfaction and product he reaped from a continual ſtudy and ſcrewing of his Brain; ſo that ſometimes to indulge his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted mind with eaſe and ceſſation of thoughts, he would betake himſelf to a Temple hallowed to the name of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to whom he as often proſtituted himſelf a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. In this Temple was a Prieſteſs who had great intereſt and acquaintance with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lady, who lived in the neighbourhood. Theſe two frequently keeping together, gave <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> an Opportunity, now and then of ſeemg the latter, till at laſt he was caught in Cupids net. As for her form, ſhe (in his judgement) ſurpaſſ'd all that ever he had ſeen in his life time. To give you a relation of his deportment were a needleſs underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

            <p>Thus having obtained the full enjoyment of his deſires, was in ſome meaſure content with the Merchandiſe he had purchaſed with the ſurrender of his freedom; hoping that his gains in time would be a hopefull iſſue, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was, for ſhortly after ſhe preſented him with her pourtraiture, which he had moulded after the Original, and was ſo well imitated in lineaments and Symmetrie, that had not the Dimenſions had imparity, it had been hard to determine which was the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,</hi> which the <hi>Copy,</hi> as far as regards the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: an ofſpring which ſeemed by the kind Heavens to be indowed with Sprite and Livelyneſs.

            <p>The Child being born, his Father thought it a duty incumbent on him to baptize him, which he alſo did, and under a name whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable to his then afflictions, which we are deſirous for this time to wave, the more becauſe we are not willing to give any offence to his Friends and Alliance, many of whom are ſtill living, much leſs, to be the occaſion of any diſadvantage, or be injurious to their Eſtate or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but (notwithſtanding the juſt merits of his wicked practiſes might not deſerve it) we will ſhroud him under the name of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes de Lebechea:</hi> which we borrow from an Appellative that exactly ſuits his drift and humour; for the word <hi>Lebeche</hi> imports as much as the <hi>Southwest Wind,</hi> to which he may be fitly compared, being vain and light in his thoughts and projects, and managing his affairs and actions without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as the Sun of Earthly Fortune ſometimes ſhone with his acceptable rays upon his thoughts, being (as it were) Weſterly, but wavering from the point again produced him (like a ſouth wind) a ſhower of Tears,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41556:9"/>
as is frequenty conſpicuous with thoſe who ſettle their Foundations in the wind, not tilling nor cultivating their mind, but willingly content themſelves with thoſe weeds, which are the proper products of nature.</p>
            <p>At firſt he grew up in Strength and health, being of a good and handſom form, both in body and viſage, and in every thing elſe promiſing enough; from which his father received no ſmall complacency, but after that depth of grief and ſorrow which he had upon the deceaſe of his endeared conſort, he began to comfort himſelf with the life of her only ſon and offſpring. After a few years he put put him out to School, where in a ſhort time he had made himſelf maſter of Reading, Writing, Arithmetick and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Accompts, partly by the Diligence of good Maſters, and partly by the help of his own forwardneſs and wit. His Father, who hereat was well ſatisfied, determined after this his happy Progreſs, in that kind of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, to put him forth to ſome Trade or other, and in as much as he was in his Childhood very artificial at plating of hair, he judged it beſt to put him to a Perriwig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, as ſoon after he did to one at <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xels: Diomedes</hi> had no great Contentment in this trade, thinking himſelf never able to gain ſo much by it, as would anſwer his

Pleaſures, or to maintain him at ſuch a rate as he deſired to live in, at once to enjoy both plenty and eaſe.</p>
            <p>Scarcely was he arrived at the 14. Year of his age, before his Father got his <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> and bad adieu to the World: and inaſmuch as he lived a merry life, ſo it could not be ſuppoſed that he ſhould leave much behind him, as he did not, ſave a Catalogue of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; which gave <hi>Diomedes</hi> little occaſion of hopes to advance his future Fortune by his Patrimony: Yet ſtill was he prompted with a groundleſs Opinion, as that ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable might be reſerved for him in the Cabinet of <hi>Chance,</hi> as uſually is obſervable in many who are prone to judge according as they would willingly have it to fall out, and ſo was conſtant in conſidering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he might quit that mean and irkſome imployment of his, and undertake ſome other courſe to bring him in a way to get riches, and live a ſplendid life. No mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he could imagine ſeemed better to like him than Merchandiſe, which he had often heard his Father ſpeak of, who had conſumed a conſiderable ſum that way, by a negligent managament of his affairs therein: willing for that very reaſon to inſtruct his only ſon in ſome honeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Calling or other, as more ſtable and ſure, though very much diſagreeing

            <p>Amongſt ſeveral Projects he deviſed, one he pitch'd upon, which without much loſs of time he put in practiſe; For, upon a morning betimes he roſe up, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Shop he privately took ſix, or ſeven of the beſt Perriwigs he could come at, which he put up. The evening before, he had expoſtulated very hard with his Maſter, to take one daies recreation or two, with ſome friends of his, who deſired him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them a litle on their Journey, which after ſome earneſt entreatys his Maſter at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt aſſented to, hoping according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41556:11"/>
which he met with in a Tavern: and after they had exchanged a few words he entred into an agreement with him for a certain ſum of money, half of which he was to pay in hand, and that he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in that Myſtery and Traffique, and during the time of his ſervice to have his Diet and Lodging with his Maſter.</p>
            <p>This Merchant had an only daughter, called <hi>Aemilia,</hi> of a reaſonable Stature, and a more than ordinary Beauty, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> took a great fancy for, though more for the circumſtances of her purſe than perſon; inſomuch that he began to bend his ſtudy, how to pleaſe her; which (as he was himſelfe ſenſible of) could not be with ſuch eaſe accompliſhed, by one who had not an Eſtate to command, as ſome of his Corrivals had; however, <hi>hap hazard,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvs to put the work in practiſe, and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated the ſum of his inclinations to her, and under a colour of Vertue, Love and Fidelity he brought the buſines ſo far, that, he had fully inſinuated himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her favour, and began to aſſure himſelf that he would ſhortly become Maſter of her Eſtate.

ſome Wines he highly approved of; he whoſe turn it was to taſt firſt took a ſwindg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing draught, after which he was ſenſible that liquor was fitter to provoke thirſt than to quench it, cried out, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils drink have I got here in my mouth? ſurely this is fetch't from <hi>Styx</hi> or <hi>Cocitus,</hi> or is it the piſſ of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the dog of hell?

Are theſe the Tears of <hi>Bacchus?</hi> ſure his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has cried to think you have not given him his due, or lodg'd him here in the dark as not worthy of light; Nay Sir, keep this wine till Latter Lammas for me; beleeve me you may keep it yet a hundred; years before it will ſtink if you ſalt it at this rate. The Merchant himſelf was no leſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, being almoſt beſides himſelf, in meeting with ſo ſtrange a <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> The firſt thing he did was to examin his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whence it came; but he, who was never at a ſtand for want of Impudence, gave him a reſolute anſwer, That he knew not: Probably, added he, it may be a divine Bleſſing that is light upon you above all others that deal in Wine, when as they in theſe dead times are fain to keep their Wine ſo long till it begins to ſtink, but you are out of danger of yours, it being well temper'd with Salt, which renders it a commodity not ſo eaſily damnified with

keeping as theirs is. Hereat his Maſter was in ſuch a fury, that if thoſe honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, in whoſe preſence it happen'd, had not ſtop'd the courſe of his rage, he had ſent him at one blow to Salute his Grandſir. The Maſter excuſing himſelf in the beſt wiſe he could to his Cuſtomers, went to another Hogſhead, which he found was no better then the firſt, and ſo on to every piece, one by one, but to his great aſtonishment found them all in the like <hi>pickle,</hi> being almoſt three Cellars full, and the beſt not worth a groat, where we will leave them to make their bargain.</p>
            <p>The ſame evening <hi>Diomedes</hi> went to three Labourers, who had helpt him the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſmuggle ſome Wines, gave'um four Ducatoons a man, and told them that his Maſter had ordered it for their former help and ſervice, and that about a moneth after he would have the like occaſion, and would give them the ſame wages, provided they would by writing acknowledge that that money was given them for their paſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that they would ſerve him again for the like ſum: Or if they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſo, only to give a diſcharge under their hands for the money received; which laſt was accepted: whereupon <hi>Diomedes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his Maſter, and boldly deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Daughter, the Maſter in a hot paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41556:13"/>
bad him be gone out of doors, or he would break his pate for him. <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> then to uſe the advantage he had againſt him, threatned to diſcover his Stealing of Cuſtome, Exciſe, &amp;c. if he would not give his aſſent to what he demanded; which the Maſter not much regarding but perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſtill in his wonted humour, at laſt got him worſted out of his houſe. <hi>Diomedes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went to an Officer of Juſtice (whoſe duty it is, here, to take notice of ſuch Delinquents) and informed him about his Maſters practiſe, ſignifying the like to the Farmers and Commiſſioners of the Impoſitions of wine, who ruminated his Cellars from end to end, and thorowly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the matter of the Labourers, that had been aſſiſting in the running and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Goods, adding well to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by declaring upon what account they had received that money; which when they had thorowly inſpected found the Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tardy, as well from the clear Confeſſion of thoſe men who had received the Money as from the number of the Pieces of wine he had in his Cellar which he had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; inſomuch that theſe <hi>Gravaminas</hi> requiring an Expiation too heavy for him to bear, was fain to retire, and leave his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houſe and Goods to the Mercy of the Officers and Farmers of the Impoſitions.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41556:13"/>
Neither did he ommit to make Complaint againſt the wicked practiſe of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> in damnifying his wine with ſalt, demanding Juſtice againſt him, and ſatisfaction for the Injury received; whom when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look for, found that he had made his eſcape, and taken his dear daughter along with him, (being as it ſeems over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway'd by the vigour of Love) and about five hundred Ducats of Gold, which he no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perceived but he fell into a ſtrange Fit, in which he lay ſeveral hours before he came to himſelf. The loſs not only of his Wine and Money, but alſo of his only Child and Reputation, brought him into a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which caſt him juſt to deaths-door: Nevertheleſs, deſiring before his death that his daughter should be enquired after: if poſſibly by the ſight of her, and the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of part of his Money, he might add a litle to his Days; but finding no means to get her again, unleſs he would frankly forgive <hi>Diomedes,</hi> of thoſe many crimes he was factious of, and ſo with his full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ratify the Marriage between him and his daughter, he was forc'd to comply; and ſo accordingly they were call'd home, the Match in every point confirm'd and the young Couple received into their Fathers houſe and Favour; altho the Father not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that Phyſicians could prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41556:14"/>
or apply expired his utmoſt; and left <hi>Diomedes</hi> in full Poſſeſſion of his Eſtate, which was no ſmall cauſe of Joy to him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceaſe and Interrment of the old man, <hi>Diomedes mourned</hi> Court fashion, not in a purple weed, but in making many Jovial hours, every day holiday and good chear, leaving the direction and management of his Merchandiſe of wines (which he ſtill continued) to the care of two ſervants of his, who ſerved him as faithfully as ever he did his Maſter before him.</p>
            <p>Neither was it indeed poſſible for <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> to leave the tricks he had learn'd of his Maſter, or Father in law: Nay, he eſteemd it a ſin to pay full Exciſe for his Goods; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ready to accomodate and deal with thoſe that had a mind to ſmuggle; and that not only with perſons of the meaneſt rank, but alſo with the moſt eminent in the Town, ſome through an inſatiable deſire they had to wine, others who out of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſitie were ſo liberal to good fellowſhip and acquaintance, as that they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that it ſhould be known at the Exciſe Office what wine they conſumed. <hi>Diomedes</hi> conſidering this, playd upon the other hand, and made a mixture of his Wines with water.</p>

himſelf never too guilty of Fidelity, muſt needs ſometimes harbour and entertain ſome ſuſpicion of the like deportment from his men, which even now have the ſame oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities he had once himſelf; his Jealouſie mov'd him to come upon them at unawars for ſeveral times one after another, but finding no ground for his Jealouſie, he from thence forward repoſed more confidence in them than before, thinking for a certainty they did not transgreſs their Duty.</p>
            <p>It happened on a time when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deliver ſome Wines, which having brought into Lighters, before they came to the Boom (or Water-bar) it was lockt, ſo that they could not get through to the ſtream, and were fain for that night to keep aboard the Lighters and watch the Wines. This opportunity fell out very well for the ſervants, who invited four or five of their fellows to bouze a glaſs with them, who made not many refuſals; ſo to 't they went and were all equally paid off before the Sun roſe, and although the Tuns were without Cocks or Spiggots, yet to ſupply that defect they made uſe of their Crane or Pipe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they of that Myſtery are wont to exhauſt wine out of Caſks, and made uſe of their hats till about midnight, when they found 2 or 3 foul glaſſes, which they rinc'd and made uſe of: theſe were in a perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41556:15"/>
till the morning began to appear and commanded their diſſolution, and each to do his duty, although they were fitter to go to bed by far. When the Water-bar was open, they went forth in good order, but whither they knew not; till at laſt one of'em eſpied a ſhip riding off in the ſtream, ready to ſet ſail, concluded abſolutely that that was the ſhip ordain'd to take in the Wine; and ſo one of them called out, Oho, the Fly boat, Ehey they aboard the ſhip ſaluted them with the like voice, and asked what they would have; We have brought here the Wine (quoth one of them) that our Maſter, Monſ. <hi>de Lebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> was to ſend aboard you, pray let us be diſcharged with the firſt, for we muſt be back again with all expedition. The Maſter of the ſhip ſeeing the Gentlemen between Hawk and Buſſard, and ſo much wine preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him without the freight, he pittied them and took in the Preſent, and preſently after both wind and weather favouring he ſit ſail for the <hi>Texel,</hi> in Order to proceed on his voyage, and let the lighter and men find the way home. The men that were aboard the ſhip being all Engliſh, ſave the Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thought that it was ſome Merchandize he had bought for himſelf, not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Netherdutch Language. But to return back again with the Lighter and guide them home; <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing his men

in ſuch a pickle began to fear all was not well. He asked them on what ſhip they had delivered; they told him aboard the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſhip that lay (ready to ſet ſail) off in the ſtream; being neither able to give any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcription of the ſhip, or what ſhe had in her ſtern. Hereat <hi>Diomedes</hi> was in ſuch a paſſion that nothing could appeaſe him, though all to no purpoſe; he went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the New bridge with his men, and with a pair of Oars went to enquire of all the ſhips, that lay before the pales of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he found nothing more than what he leſt ſought; continuing ſtill railing againſt his men who were in a condition fit to take a nap, needing neither <hi>Diacodium</hi> nor <hi>Opium</hi> for a provocative. At laſt <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing an Engliſh Ketch, he made towards her and very bluntly asked them about the Wine they took in that Morning, and whether it belonged to them: The men ſwore they had not taken in any wine: <hi>Diomedes</hi> overſwayd by his Fury jumpt out of the boat and aboard he went, bidding the Maſter to ſhow what goods he had aboard, or he would brand him for a Rogue, and ſhow what he had to do with him. The Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man not a whit behind him, began to threaten him as faſt, and told him that for his uncivility he would not reſolve him in his doubt, but as he had Stigmatized him

muſt they do? Every minute adds to time. It will not be long before it will be day, people will preſently be going about their reſpective buſineſſes, and the Cock begins to proclaim the morn to the world. <hi>Emilia</hi> was hereat in ſuch a conſternation, that if ſhe had not been hindred by her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would have thrown her ſelf headlong into the Haven. At laſt one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that ſhe had a Niece, or Couſin who liv'd alone with a maid, and that ſhe had good hopes of coming in there, without much noiſe or diſcovery: And indeed this liked them all, ſo that they went all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſaid houſe, which was litle leſs than half a mile, and ſo knock'd at the door ſeveral times, before any anſwer was made: at laſt the maid comes to the door and demanded who was there; which when ſhe perceived who it was, opened the door; The Gentlewoman, who was the only one that had acquaintance there, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her, if her Miſtres was within; She replyed, Yes; deſiring farther, that ſhe would pleaſe to pay her viſit the next day, withall telling her, that her Miſtres was not very well diſpoſed, and had been above 3. or 4. hours in bed: but all in vain for being excited with the cruel torments of the cold, and impatience to tarry there any longer, one of them puſh'd open the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41556:21"/>
door in order to go in, and ſeconded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was followed by all the reſt; the maid knowing then for a certain who it was, and that no better would be, went grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in, and told her Miſtreſs that her couſin was there, with ſome other company, and urg'd mightily to ſpeak with her. The Gentlewoman immediately ſlips on her night-gown, and bad the maid, to light a candle, and bring it to the door, for they were all this while in the dark: which ſhe did; and was hardly got into the ſhop but ſeeing Ten or twelve women, and 3 or 4 men all in their ſhirts &amp; ſmocks (as was ſaid) ſhe out of very fear lets the candle drop, and away out of door, half naked; thinking that it had been many, Ghoſts ſo or that there was ſome Exorciſm in the caſe.</p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Magdalen</hi> (for that was the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans name) hearing this noiſe was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at it; yet although ſhe was indeed by nature a little timorous, ſhe reſolves to go down and ſee what was the matter. And ſo taking a candle in her hand ſhe makes toward the ſtairs which led down to the ſhop, and ſeeing there a whole Chorus of perſons in their ſurplices, was worſe affrighted, than the maid, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fell down in a ſwound. The naked company ſeeing what had happened, made the work as ſhort as they could, went in

Immediately they went about, ſeeking in every corner and cupboard for Vinegar, by the uſe of which they brought her to her ſelf again, and made a ſhift to lay her upon the bed which was yet warm, and cover'd her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. The Gentlewoman who ſtill in a weak condition, as one that is but newly brought abed, begun to get a litle more heart; and requeſted of them, that they would be ſo free as to let her know the ground of the matter, and what was the cauſe, of this their being in ſuch a poſture and condition, which they to ſatisfy her curioſity begin to relate, in manner as we have already told you, without the leaſt cohibition of any point, either out of fear or ſhame; which done they crept to bed again together, taking each of them what ſheets, ruggs and blankets they could get, to keep'um warm: though not in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as before: For the women looking upon this as a divine piece of Juſtice for their Guilt, reſolved not to ingage any more with their Paramours, but made a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo kept themſelves at a diſtance, but could not cloſe their eies together all

and brought them out of the doubt they were in; ſo that it was not poſſible for the poor captives to deny any thing, the caſe and matter being ſo probable and palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. One or two of them knowing (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) the mild diſpoſition of their husbands fell down upon their bare knees, earneſtly and humbly begging that they would vouch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſafe in clemency to pardon this great and hainous misdemeanour, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for their fury was not ſo eaſily appeaſed.

The Officer thus taking care for the Offending parties, the men went home with great contrition for what had paſt, and never enjoyed their uſual contentment till they had got themſelvs divorced from their wives, which after ſome ſolicitations they procured. <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> being ſenſible that if he parted with his wife, he muſt according to law, part with his whole Eſtate and Goods, chuſed rather to accept of the promiſe of reformation ſhe tendred him, and her ingagement, to

His Cellars were as empty of Wine, as his Coffers were of Money, and he thought it was high time for him to ſeek remedy for his Credit which lay in it's laſt pangs, at laſt he found out a project he thought might caſt the ballance. On a morning betimes he went to a Ship-carpenter, with whom he had ſome ſmall acquaintance, and deſired to view 3 new Ships he had built for ſale. The Carpenter glad he had got a cuſtomer for his Ships, went with him, and ſhow'd him them all over, and after a few words ſtruck a bargain with him for all three, for 70 thouſand Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and accordingly Writings were drawn, ſpecifying the ſum and manner of pay ment, which was to be upon 3 May days: The Builder who did not queſtion his ſufficiency, let him have the ſhips without the leſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which he cheerfully took into poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Having got theſe three ſhips into Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he, by the help of ſome Brokers ſold two of them, and the third ſold out to Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners reſerving an eighth part to himſelf, ſo that he was ſpeedily ſupplyed with money, and in a capacity to bring up his <hi>Quota,</hi> in order to the fitting out that whereof he was in part Owner, as in the Spring following ſhe undertook a Voyage to <hi>Spain.</hi>

upon him repoſing great confidence and fidelity in Monſr: <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> not fearing to receive any diſadvantage in the leaſt by him, but deeming them as ſafe, as if they were in his own Cheſt under a hundred locks. The morning being come, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf ready, ſore againſt his will took his leave of Seigneur <hi>Leopoldo,</hi> feigning great haſt, departs: but inſtead of going to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he went directly for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> when there was a very pleaſant Manſion houſe to be ſold, ſituate near <hi>Haarlem,</hi> in which <hi>Diomedes</hi> had a great liking, and determines to purchaſe it, without counting the coſt, or weighing the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the money that ſo unneceſſary a thing as a Countrey Summer-dwelling might come to ſtand him in.</p>
            <p>Arriving at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> he forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to the Sale, where hearing the Conditions read; he underſtood that it was to be paid at 3 ſeveral payments, each payment at the expiration of ſix moneths, one after another, which pleaſed him well, and the better to bring his purpoſe to effect, he took with him 2 or 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gentlemen, into whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance he had ſubtilly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf, under the notion of one of the moſt eminent Merchants in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which they alſo beleeved by ſome

circumſtantial words he negligently ſeem'd to let fall: theſe Gentlemen he intreated to aſſiſt him herein, being (as he made them believe (come thither to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to purchaſe that Countrey-houſe, praying further the kindneſs of them that if they refuſed to paſs it over to him without ready money, in default of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, they would be ſo kind, as to be his Security, which they were free to do.</p>
            <p>When the Sale began, <hi>Diomedes</hi> watch'd his bacon, and bad at a round rate, being all the while the leading man; at laſt got the bargain, and a Good Luck to boot; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to perform the firſt payment within 10 days, and giving good &amp; ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the reſt, they were content, Which ended, <hi>Diomedes</hi> departed for <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leburg,</hi> to compleat the time he promiſed to return in from <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened that he met with a Jokky by the way, at an Jun, who had 4 neat Coach-horſes to ſell, which liked <hi>Diomedes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, ſo that he reſolved to buy them, and aſking the price, the Jokkey offered them at twelve hundred gilders; he thinking that too much, bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſet forward toward the <hi>Hague</hi> where he bought a Coach, and hired a Coach and Foot-man, fully purpoſing thence forward to live like a Perſon of Quality.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate he came to the houſe of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poldus,</hi> with Coach and Horſes, himſelf and Retinue all in mourning, complements <hi>Leopoldus</hi> in courteous manner, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the deceaſe of his Uncle, which Mr. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> hearing, immediately reſcontred him with a complement of Condolency. After their complements were ended and <hi>Diomedes</hi> introduced into the Parlour, he begun to relate how ſtrangely he happened to hearken out the perſon, who had loſt the money (mentioned pag. 50,) and that upon his giving the real tokens of the Sum. and Species; he reſtored it him again. Yet all this would not bring him home to his purpoſe, which he ſhortly after put in practiſe. He humbly prays the return of his Box of Writings which were brought forth, and he after the paſſing of many Complements expreſſing his gratitude, took his leave, and poſted for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he ſet up his Horſe in a Hackney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, till he had hired one of his own, where he ordered his Coachman to attend. Now nothing remained ſave his houſe, which was not furniſhed with Moveables ſuitable to the Grandour, he for the future

purpoſed to live in. Hereupon he applies himſelf to a Painter, famous for Work, and Judgement, and one whoſe name I have ſeen ſet to many ſpurious pieces, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſemble his way of working, to make them give a greater price: of this Painter he bought 14 choice pieces, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining for the whole for 3200 gilders, which he promiſed to ſend him, the Painter not in the leaſt miſtruſting, or doubting of his honeſty was content to part with his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon thoſe terms, without further care.</p>
            <p>Having thus cullied the Painter with thoſe Ornamentals, wherewith he garniſhed his houſe. In the next place he directs his courſe to a Woolen-Draper where he bought to the value of 800 gilders in Cloth, Bays and other Mourning ſtuffs, making the people believe he had an Uncle lately dead; at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who had left him a great Eſtate, which they beleeving gave him credit, greedy of his cuſtome for the future.</p>
            <p>And although he had hitherto well effected his purpoſe, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>With theſe hopes he reſted content, as do moſt men of deſperate Fortunes aſwell on the other hand.

                  <hi>Angelica</hi> was all this time in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation about this facinorous act, which her lover had perpetrated in ſuch a degenerate and ignoble manner, and yet could not ſound the Occaſion or ground of the matter. But what grieved her more, was his perpetual Abſence, which could not be remedied without forfeiture of his head. At laſt ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to applie her ſelf to ſome Eminent Miniſter of State to beg a Pardon for him, as ſuddenly ſhe bethought her of a fair Opportunity, having a near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Mothers ſide, who was a ſpecial Favourite of the King, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

of rare Conduct and great Gravity.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as ſhe hadintimated the Caſe he went to give attendance at the door of the Audience Chamber, &amp; was after a few minutes waiting admitted into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, preferr'd an Exhibition of the Caſe of <hi>Theobald,</hi> with a Supplication for Pardon, to which his Majeſty was pleaſed to give his Royal aſſent Returning thus to Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> with a pardon in his hand, ſhe diſpatched letters to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> who underſtanding himſelf a free Remmiſſionary, came boldly home, and apply'd himſelf to his Lady, to return her thanks for the grand reſpect and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhe had manifeſted towards him: renewing his ſuit, and confirming his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Conſtancy to her; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them he ratified by deep proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his ſincere meaning, binding himſelf with a grievous Curſe never to recede from what he had already by Oath obliged his Conſcience to. She on the other hand was not remiſs to retaliate his Inclinations; and not only after the ſame manner vow'd a ſtability of Promiſe and Purpoſe, but allowed and accepted of his Oaths and Proteſtations as ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction enough to expunge all jealouſie ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41556:52"/>
had already promiſed without any thing more to be ſaid by way of Addition. Thus reſting ſecure of each others Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they began to grow a litle more familiar, than you'l ſay (perhaps) was ſeemly: ſo for that I would not willingly uſe the freedom to commemorate it at this time, leſt I ſhould be tax'd with immodeſty for my pains.</p>
               <p>When they had thus <hi>fruitfully</hi> ſpent their time for ſome few daies together, and <hi>Theobald</hi> already cloy'd in Pleaſure, laughs to think how he had attained the ſcope of his Deſires; he takes a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to come into her Company again, and forgetting her great favours, and the ſignal marks of Love ſhe had ever ſhown him, he began to contemn her. Her Love he rewards with hatred, her ſervice with Contempt, her Fidelity with Falſhood, her Zeal to preſerve his life, with cruel Revilings and Tauntings for what he was himſelf equally guilty of.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Angelica</hi> had with great Patience expected the coming of her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, but neither ſeeing, not hearing of him, ſhe was wholly altered, fearing that ſhe had deceived her ſelf in being too credulous. She ſends her Page forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to his houſe, who deſiring to ſpeak with him, <hi>Theobald</hi> ſent him word that

he had nothing to do with him, nor any he was any ways concern'd with, and that he would not have any Match-makers or Wench-brokers to tread his threſhold. The Page returns with this anſwer, which ſo ſurpriz'd the Lady that ſhe was almoſt diſtraught, blaming her ſelf for being too apt to beleeve the many Proteſtations of her Lover, aſwell as him for his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: yet ever would comfort her ſelf with theſe thoughts, That he might probably do it to try her, although found her ſelf ſhortly after in a grievous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when news was brought her that <hi>Hilary</hi> was ſtill alive, and returned home from the Court Imperial, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> upon his arrival was ſet forward upon a journey for <hi>Italy,</hi> having taken all his Patrimony with him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Theobald</hi> arrives firſt at <hi>Milain,</hi> where he purpoſed to ſpend a litle time; but as Fate would have it, grows weary of the place, alters his Reſolution and ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>Genua.</hi> Comeing then to <hi>Genua</hi> found there an opportunity to tranſport himſelf for <hi>Venice,</hi> and in order to his Voyage imbarques himſelf aboard a ſmall

Pinnace bound for the <hi>Hadriatic</hi> Sea. So ſoon as they had reached the heighth of <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> were aſſail'd by two Corſairs belonging to <hi>Argiers,</hi> which without much conteſt took them, carried up the Pinnace to <hi>Argiers,</hi> and brought <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi> with the reſt of the Captive Slaves to the market, where they were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſale. Our Gentleman, being well limb'd and of a robuſt body was not long there before he was ſold to a <hi>Moor,</hi> who forthwith clapt a maſſy ponderous chain to his leggs, and let him ly in a kennel, like a dog at his chamber door. I doubt not but by that time he was ſenſible of his miſery, not only to be brought to the Condition of a Slave, from a State ſo Noble and happy, but at the ſame time to be deprived of all he could call his own in the World, and ſo rendred uncapable of his own Redemption and to acquire a livelyhood for the future.</p>
               <p>While he thus had hardly time enough, to bewail the ſad and deplorable effects of his temerous and inſubid Actions, conſulted now and then with his hard and uneaſy pillow, how he might make his eſcape; but all to litle or no purpoſe; for he had no leſs than three locks to break, beſides his chain.

By theſe and the like arguments ſhe inſtanced, <hi>Hillary</hi> was drawn to compaſſion with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and liberally paid down half the Ranſom. <hi>Angelica</hi> having brought it to this paſs, perpetually furthered the matter till ſhe got her Vaſſal home.

At the time appointed the friends on both ſides repair to the wedding, and <hi>Angelica,</hi> trick'd up in gorgeous attire, waits for the joyfull coming of her Bridegroom; but he inſtead of coming to receive his Bride, and perform the Nuptial ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies according to his Oath and Duty; broke up a Money-cheſt of his brothers and ran away with a notorious ſtrumpet, leaving <hi>Angelica</hi> to comfort her ſelf with what he had left her in pawn.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Lady fell in labour, and was delivered of a brave ſon having the very features of his Father. The child ſhe ſent away clandeſtinely into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, yet not with ſuch privacy, but that the matter was noiſed preſently abroad, as uſually happens in ſuch caſes, ſhe kept her bed for ſeveral weeks together, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning up her witts along, how ſhe might order her affairs with her treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lover, who had thus unkindly dealt with her. By that time ſhe had recovered her ſtrength, <hi>Theobald</hi> comes home, and applies himſelf to his brother, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him reception, and threatned if he did not immediately depart to turn him over into the hands of Juſtice; he mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

with Inſtructions to invite him to Supper with her, and reconcile their Difference, with a Glaſs of Wine. It was a matter of doubt whether <hi>Theobald</hi> was more amazed or overjoy'd at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Invitation; but holding it for the wiſeſt Courſe to take her in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, promiſed he would give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and accordingly at the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed where ſhe (as far as her inward fury would diſpence with) courteouſly received him, with all imaginable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of joy, and Carreſſes.

            <p>So ſoon as this ſtory was ended, gave each man his Opinion about the ſame, which that we may not detain you with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſcourſe we ſhall ommit. <hi>Manvelius</hi> in the mean time gave his Gueſts great Contentment with a laudable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where plenty of every thing that might add delight to the Eie, or Pallat, was as it were poured out of a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> Nor were the Gueſts tardie to acknowledge the ſame, expreſſing their great ſatisfaction by variety of Complemental Elogies on this ſplendid Treat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> (who all this time ſeems to have lain dormient) was not remiſs to afford what mirth he could to the Company, in telling of ſeveral pretty ſtories, of which he was well furniſhed.</p>
            <p>Among the Gueſts was a certain Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> whoſe name, how well it agreed with her temper, you may judge by the ſequel. This Gentlewoman ſuited the humour of <hi>Diomedes</hi> as well as ſhe could, till at laſt <hi>Diomedes</hi> was ſo far ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with her that he coveted what was not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41556:58"/>
conſiſtent with Vertue; and at laſt they underſtood one another ſo well that ſhe went into a Chamber alone, whither he follow'd, and was for ſome time held up with a few Ceremonies, not much pertinent to the matter he came about, till ſhe made a ſhift to pillage him of a Gold watch of a very high value, which he not once perceived. This done they parted without any further miſchief, and full ſatisfaction to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who contrary to his purpoſe miſs'd his Venereal Corrolary where with, he thought to compleat his Epicurean Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. After the Gueſts had given the uſual Complement to <hi>Manvelius</hi> they departed each to his habitation; <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who all this while knew not of his loſs, goes to bed, and in the morning when he awoke, began to look for his watch to ſee what a clock it was, but found it not.</p>
            <p>Yet was he not ſo much concern'd at the loſs, as that he knew not who ſhould be the Thief, and was in default of proof conſtrain'd to hold his tongue and put up the matter in quiet.</p>
            <p>A few days after came <hi>Manvelius</hi> to give him a viſit, accompanied with Monſr. <hi>le Cocq</hi> the Frenchman, and a third perſon, who in the project was to repreſent a ſtrange Merchant. <hi>Manvel</hi> upon his firſt ſaluting him, began to beg excuſe for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41556:58"/>
and ſo gradually proceeded on to the purpoſe. Sir ſaid he, I am heartily ſorry that I am neceſſitated to give you a trouble which I litle dream'd on, this Gentleman having made a journey expreſsly to receive a ſum I am owing him, and has happened to come juſt as I am out of Caſh, having yeſterday paid off 3 conſiderable Summs, and the day before cleared Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts with ſome of my Correſpondents, ſo that being out of moneys, I beſeech you be ſo kind, as to ſupply me with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducatoons, for three Moneths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will highly oblige me to do the like or greater favour, when your Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and my Opportunity concurr. <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> jointly conſidering <hi>Manvelius</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Civility, could not deny him, counts down the money. <hi>Manvelius</hi> hereupon ſhows him a Blank bond which he had made, wherein Diomedes was to confeſs himſelf to have a Diamond-Ring of <hi>Manvels</hi> for a Pledge, which he deſired him to ſign. To this Diomedes aſſents, on Condition <hi>Manvel</hi> was to ſign another for the money.

Contents was, That <hi>Diomedes</hi> confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Debter to <hi>Manvel</hi> in the Sum of 25000 <hi>gl.</hi> which <hi>Diomedes,</hi> not ſenſible of the fraud, without any difficulty ſigns. This done, <hi>Manvel</hi> and his Company took their leave of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> well ſatisfied that the matter took ſo well.</p>
            <p>This Miſchance was alſo ſeconded by another. For a certain Boor living near <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> who had in former time been deceived by <hi>Diomedes,</hi> took upon him to be revenged on him for it, which he thus put in practiſe.</p>
            <p>He had in his houſe a ſervant-maid to whom he imparted his aggrievance, and withall told her his purpoſe of retaliation. To this maid he gave Inſtructions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her 2 pair of Pendants, the one pair fine, the other falſe, but ſo like each other in faſhion that an ordinary Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not diſtinguiſh them. With theſe ſhe poſts away to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> where coming to ſpeak with him, ſhe profferd them to ſale, telling him that ſhe was of good parentage, notwithſtanding her then being in the ſtate of a Servant, in which ſtate ſhe had diligently ſerved for ſeveral years together, and ſo ſaved a ſmall ſum of money, which ſhe then intended to diſpoſe of to an advantagious end, only wanted about an hundred gilders more, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41556:59"/>
ſhe pray'd him that he would do her the favour to lend her upon the Pendants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> who had a reaſonable Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Jewels could not value them leſs than 6 times the money, readily gave her the Sum ſhe aſk'd upon them, on Condition ſhe ſhould pay 15 ſt. per moneth Intereſt, and ſign'd a Writing whereby he confeſſed to have received ſuch Jewels from her, which upon payment of the moneys lent he was obliged to make reſtitution of.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was buſy in writing the ſaid Note, the Wench clandeſtinely drew out the falſe Pendants, and Convey'd the true into her Handkercheif, which ſhe lay on the table, as a neceſſary inſtrument for a <hi>Hocus pocus</hi> trick in time of need.</p>
            <p>For that time they took their leaves of each other, and the maid returns to her maſter, and told him what had paſs'd, which pleaſ'd him extremely well.</p>
            <p>Some time after the Peaſant came to <hi>Diomedes</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and preſented him a bargain of Oxen, promiſing to affoard him a good penny-worth, and a long day of Payment. This pleaſed <hi>Diomedes</hi> extremely well, having found ſo rare an occaſion to chouſe the Clown, ſo that he deemed it more than a venial ſin, to neglect ſuch a golden opportunity: he therefore returns the Peaſant anſwer, that he would take a

            <p>By that time <hi>Diomedes</hi> was got home, and hardly got a good nights reſt, came <hi>Manvelius</hi> to ſalute his Knaveſhip; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with one to pay the 20000 gild.

was debated, <hi>Diomedes,</hi> loſt the tryal: upon which he appeals to a higher Court, where at that time he had another Trial, which was but of ſmall moment, and that he won, but this which was of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, was given againſt him; and he condemned to pay the money, which he did without ſhowing himſelf much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the matter: though reſolved to be revenged by ſome ſtratagem or other; which alſo ſucceeded well.

            <p>In the mean time Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> the Mock-Baron, ſends to know whether <hi>Manvel,</hi> was gone or not; and being informed he was, goes with his Pages <hi>pro tempore,</hi> to <hi>Manvels'</hi> wife, to act the Part intended. <hi>Diomedes</hi> had in the mean time aſſured him that ſhe was a briſk, open hearted Dame, and therefore gave him incouragement to

When he had got acceſs and found her in every thing congruous with the Character <hi>Diomedes</hi> had given him, he began firſt to entertain her with ſoft and fair diſcourſe, and ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to take a larger liberty, till he had got the ſcope he aim'd at, and won her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to go to bed with him.

When the Pages ſaw that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Within 2 days after arrived <hi>Manvel</hi> from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and hearing what had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was very ill at eaſe, wiſhing that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he reſolves to eaſe himſelf of the latter, and in order thereto goes about to get a Divorce, which was granted him: Upon which he returns his wife her Dowry reſerving but a very mean Portion for himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes,</hi> although in ſome regard ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently revenged, yet was not ſatisfyed with this but ſoon after put another thing in practiſe.</p>
            <p>He had acquaintance with one <hi>Luke</hi> a Wine-couper, who had been privy to the moſt part of his Roguery when he ſold wine himſelf: to him he imparted his deſign, and promiſed to hold him harmleſs and run the Riſque himſelf, if he would but undertake the Act. <hi>Luke</hi> was herewith content; and according to the Inſtructions of <hi>Diomedes</hi> went to <hi>Manvel,</hi> proffering him a bargain of <hi>Rheniſh</hi> wine; which he told him he would affoard him cheaper than the common Price, becauſe he had occaſion for ready money. <hi>Manvel</hi> then ſeeing the man in a ſtrait; thought to make a prize
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41556:66"/>
of him, went with him to his Cellar, where he taſted of ſeveral Hogsheads and before he came away ſtruck a bargain with him for three thouſand Gilders, to be delivered and paid that night. <hi>Manvel</hi> then goes to make room for the Wine in his Cellar, and <hi>Luke</hi> in the mean time removes thoſe Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads which <hi>Manvel</hi> had bought, out of their place, and put others in their room, which were fill'd with ſour wine, and in every tun was a pipe made of Lattin, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly faſtned in the inſide. Theſe were filled with Gun-powder, and match faſtned to the Ends thereof, being of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length from the powder, that it could not burn ſo as to give fire for ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. By that time the Wine-couper had laid his Machin, <hi>Manvel</hi> comes in with the money, which was paid and received according to the purport of the Bargain. When he had got the Wine home, and ſet in order in the Cellar, he went to Supper, where he had ſcarcely ſitten a quarter of an hour, but he heard a fearfull cracking, and the houſe fell a ſhaking. Upon this he was not a litle altered; yet thinking, becauſe it was hot weather, that it might be thunder, he ſent one of his men to ſee if his Warehouſe windows were to; for that ſide next the ſtreet was ſtow'd with Flax. But by that time his Servant was got to the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41556:67"/>
innerdoor, the greateſt pipe took fire which made all fly about; the hoops were broken to ſhivers, and the floor of the Parlour where they ſate at Table, broke through, being directly over the Cellar where the Tuns were; and at once broke all his Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn, and a coſtly Looking-glaſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> longing to hear of the iſſue and effect of the machin, goes to a public houſe hard by, where he had not been above half an hour before he heard it crack and thunder, and ſuddenly ſaw the whole ſtreet in an alarm, none knowing what was the matter. <hi>Diomedes</hi> together with thoſe that were in the houſe ran whither they judged the report came from, and found the Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe door of <hi>Manvel</hi> open, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people at a diſtance not da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But before <hi>Manvelius</hi> was come to the midle of the ſtairs he fell down through the ſteps (the ſtair-caſe being all ſhattered looſe with the force of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) where he was up almoſt to the midle, in leckage of the wine, crying out, help! help! I drown, I ſink, I drown, I ſink, upon which one of his men which though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to pull him out came alſo tumbling down upon him, the candle falling out of his hand. <hi>Manvelius</hi> hereat ſurprized wiſt not what to think, but ſuppoſing it had been the Devil began to lay about, which the man took ſo well out that he paid him again in the ſame coin, in ſhort, they bang'd it about with ſuch courage that had not the other man come haſtily with another candle lighted, they had both ſmothered in Wine. <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who to his hearts content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was all this while a ſpectator of the ſcene, had almoſt loſt his breath with laughing, and to give <hi>Manvel</hi> a hint, cryed out, If a man were indeed ſo zealous to fight the Devil, he would ſcorn his help in cheating of honeſt men. <hi>Manvelius</hi> not able to creep through the way he came, (the dimenſion of his Gut-caſe being with the thickeſt) was fain to go out at the ſtreet door, partly becauſe of his being tipſie with tumbling in Old Rheniſh, hardly able to ſteer his Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe, and partly becauſe of the Rabble that crouded about the door. He was no ſooner come out, but the people being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive how it came, and what was the matter: when he to ſatisfy their curioſity told all he knew of the thing. <hi>Diomedes</hi> among the reſt hearing all, it ſo tickled his fancy, that he could hardly contain himſelf of laughter, which he indeavoured to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41556:68"/>
bridle ſo well as he could, to prevent ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manvelius</hi> upon this gets an Ague which kept him in his bed: finding out in the mean time the trick which was put upon him by the burſten pipes, match and ſmell of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and for the ſame ſummons the wine merchant to appear before the Magiſtrate, who could not deny the fact, but referrs himſelf to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who being likewiſe ſent for, denied to know any thing of the matter, but wholly pretending ignorance, the Wine-merchant received Sentence of Baniſhment and a Fine, by which means he was utterly ruined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> had a Couſin married to one <hi>Ambroſe</hi> with whom he held a long cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and had a great kindneſs for. About theſe happened an odd paſſage, which I hold not impertinent to inſert here, being both comical and ridiculous. This <hi>Ambroſe</hi> her huſband was one, who had but litle value or eſteem for the world, unleſs for it's Movſture, being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Love with <hi>l'eau de vie,</hi> or Brandy. Mrs. <hi>Anthonette,</hi> that was the Gentlewom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns name, was reaſonably fair, and might paſs for a beauty, but never could get the aſcendant of her huſband, who was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Bacchus</hi> than <hi>Venus.</hi> This beaſtly life of his made her almoſt weary of Life.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41556:68"/>
Never came he in without a Guid, and whether ſhe <hi>Carded</hi> or <hi>Spun</hi> at home, he was ſure to <hi>Reel</hi> abroad: and when he was come home muſt be lifted into bed. <hi>Anthonette</hi> would often admoniſh him to leave off theſe tireſome and diſhonourable Courſes, where by he did not only looſe his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt men, and make her a Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſtock to her Neighbours, but ran head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into ruin, and would at laſt reduce himſelf and her into ſuch a condition, as would render their Lives uncomfortable. But this rather provoked his Wrath than Amendment: inſomuch that he told her that if ſhe did not deſiſt and let him alone he would in place of ſpending a penny ſpend a pound, and for the future take a greater liberty than he had hitherto don. Mrs. <hi>Anthonette</hi> ſeeing that he was already with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bounds of reaſon, imparted her grievance to <hi>Diomedes</hi> praying him, if he knew any Council for her, or a mean to draw him from this looſe courſe of Life. <hi>Diomedes</hi> was (as appears by our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe) ſubtile enough in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and reſolute in putting a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practiſe, promiſed to do his beſt and aſſiſt her when he met with an opportunity, which would be beſt, when he came home drunk again.</p>
            <p>It was not needfull that he ſhould wait
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41556:69"/>
long for that Occaſion, for it was almoſt a miracle to find him ſober at night. She therefore prays <hi>Diomedes,</hi> to do it ſo ſoon as he could: and accordingly he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that night he would. <hi>Anthonette</hi> ſtood at her door in the Evening waiting for her huſband, whom at length ſhe ſaw at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſurveying the breadth of the ſtreets, with a train of boys after him, who convoy'd him to his door: where being come he complements his wife after his old mood, with his hat to the ground, and a hundred <hi>baſe los manos,</hi> till at laſt ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling upon a great ſtone, he lay as flat as a Flounder. <hi>Anthonette</hi> ſeeing him ly ſo, pray'd her Neighbours to help him in a doors, where they tug'd and wreſtled, till they got him into the Parlour. This done ſhe ſends her maid to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who without delay came and found friend <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in the condition we left him in. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> gave order to unharneſs him which was accordingly done. When he was ſtript, he wrapt him up in a Winding Sheet, and lay him handſomly in an old ſugar Cheſt and carried him down into the Cellar, where they ſtopt all the windows cloſe that he could ſee no light; and tied an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Water-dog to his feet. That done they went up. <hi>Anthonette</hi> put her ſelf into deep mourning, which ſhe had upon the

Death of her Father. <hi>Diomedes</hi> took a Goats hide which he faſtned about his bodie, that was ſo neatly contrived, that one would have taken him for a Devil, or at beſt a Monſter. Two perſons more were hired, to complete the Stage, whereof one of them was put into another che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And artificial breaſts made of two bags of ſand, which hung down to her midle. When all this was done they began to dance round about the Cheſt, roared and yelled ſo long till he awoke, which when they perceived, the two mock-devils ran and embraced him, rubbing their ſnaky wiggs againſt his cheeks, which put him into ſuch a Sweat that all he had about him was as wet as if it had lay in water, fain would he look up
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41556:70"/>
but durſt not move or ſtir, for <hi>Diomedes</hi> looked at him ſo grim, as the Devil over <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and he with his eies fix'd upon <hi>Diomedes</hi> durſt not look another way, for fear the Devil ſhould take him for a living ſoul. While they ſtood gazing at one another, the other Devil <hi>in forma</hi> came, and threw half a dozen live-eels into the Coffin which began to creep up and down over his whole body and face; yet durſt he not cry out or ſtir, for <hi>Diomedes</hi> had him ſo faſt in his eie that he held him ſtrictly in aw. When this was done, they put fire to the looſe grains of Powder, which flew all into a flame round about him.

Remember how often you have called out, Den Duyvel haalt my,</hi> The Devil fetch me, <hi>and now you ſee what a ſad condition you are in, and how he has once got you in his clutches. You have wholly dedicated your precious time to drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhall ere long, ſee the reward of ſuch impious courſes as you have made choiſe of, and have leiſure to wiſh you might live the time again, when all will be to no purpoſe. I am in the ſame condition you are in, and would (were it in my power) give ten thouſand Worlds to live my time again: but to litle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is my wiſh; my opportunity I have loſt, which can never be recalled, and the golden minutes I was ſo prodigal of, are a greater Hell to me, than Hell it ſelf as thou poor cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif, ere long, ſhalt be made ſenſible of, on thy behalf. Ambroſe</hi> hearing that really beleeved that he was dead and already before the Poſtern of Hell. After he had lay in this condition an hour or more; the two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils took him up, the one by the head,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41556:71"/>
and the other by the heels, made him faſt with ropes, and ſo dragg'd him to a Poſt, where they bound him ſo, that he could neither move hand nor foot: which done they took each a whip, that was made for the purpoſe, and one of them with a hoarſe voice bad him confeſs his Offences. He ſeeing them in good earneſt, began to mutter it out by degrees. <q>The firſt was his Drunkenneſs, as that he now and then took a cup of the Creature, more then did him good, That he had abuſed the good counſel of his wife, who had many times forewarned him of Perils conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually attending both body and ſoul. That drinking ſometimes with a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, or two, when they went aſide, he would clandeſtinly drink off a glaſs, wripe his mouth, and fill it again. That he had ſeveral times and in ſeveral places lay with ſuch and ſuch Gentlewomen.</q> This <hi>Anthonette</hi> overhearing had hardly the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hold her tongue, being now aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of what ſhe was theretofere never jealous of. When they had wrought with him ſo long as they could, and that he could confeſs no more; They let him done gently, and brought a bottle of Brandy, which they temper'd with <hi>Opium,</hi> and <hi>Diacodium;</hi> adding a litle ſpirit of Hartſhorn and <hi>Aſſa foetida;</hi> the firſt to make him ſleep, and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41556:71"/>
latter, by way of circumſtance to ſuit the Place, and Condition of the Patient. This Potion they forced him to drink, which at firſt he was unwilling to do, yet when they threatned to commit him to the Flames he quaff'd it off, hoping by his obedience, now, to be excuſed another time. This having done he was again drunk, and by the vigour and vertue of the ſleeping Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, fell into a deep ſlumber. Which being effected they brought him up into his own bed, and drew off their Infernal Robes, and put on Terreſtrial Garbs. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette</hi> remained ſtill in her mourning Weed, and one of her Aſſiſtants put on a moodiſh ſuit, ſuitable to a Gentleman of Quality, who was to repreſent a Bridegroom and the other who was to be his Friend. <hi>Diomedes</hi> was alſo in ſleight mourning, being couſin to <hi>Anthonette</hi> as was ſaid before, and <hi>Appolonia</hi> ſerved at Table. When they were all ſet, they began to dance and make a great noiſe, which at length, though hardly, awakened <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was in a thouſand troubles when he thought upon what had happened, ſometimes would indeavour to perſwade himſelf that it was only a dream or whimſy, and would vaniſh in time; yet again that it muſt aſſuredly be real, by the Wounds and boils he had about his body; and ſeeing the face of things quite altered,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41556:72"/>
it confirmed his beleef the more. At laſt ſeeing Glaſſes go round briskly, and his <hi>Anthonette,</hi> drinking to every one reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively began to cry out, <hi>Oh Good friends have a care what you do, and liſten a litle to what has happened to me.</hi> Hardly had he opened his mouth, but all roſe from the Table, and began to ſhriek out, as if they had been indeed amazed, one run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this way, and another that way, and finally every one out of the Chamber <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette</hi> only excepted, who fell down upon the floor, as if ſhe had ſounded away. This <hi>Ambroſe</hi> marking durſt not riſe up to help her, fearing to make her worſe but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call out to the maid, <hi>Appolonia, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polonia,</hi> no maid makes anſwer, <hi>Anthonet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> lies ſtill, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> lay ſtill in his bed, muſing on what was paſt, being all in a ſweat; till at laſt by the vertue of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he fell into a ſlumber again, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into a deep ſleep. This <hi>Anthonette</hi> obſerving, ſhe ran out ſoftly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſpective perſons for their ſervice and cauſed the maid to uncover the Table in the dark, without making the leſt noiſe, and ſo pulling off her Mourning Weed, went to bed, to her husband, ſleeping by him a good part of the next day.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ambroſe</hi> awaked, ſaw it was day, and found his wife by his ſide, was in a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41556:72"/>
hundred quandaries, not knowing what to ſay, or think. At laſt he began to puſh his wife till ſhe awaked, and asked her, how ſhe came there; and, If ſhe was not afraid to have a Ghoſt to her bed-fellow. <hi>Anthonette</hi> hearing him ſpeak with ſuch an abſolute zeal, could hardly contein her ſelf of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Pre'thee my Dear,</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>what doſt mean? Do you go about to make me laugh, or to put me in a fright. I beſeech you explain your ſelf, and I ſhall perhaps anſwer your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and deſign,</hi> Upon this he asked her, If he was not lately dead and ſhe about to marry with another? This coming ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly from him made her laugh whether ſhe would or no: yet made as if ſhe looked upon this as meer dotage, and the effects of wine. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſtill held on in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and did all he could to aſſeverate the paſſages which he imagined to have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened, from whence <hi>Anthonette</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Stratagem had had a good ſucceſs. Purſuing his diſcourſe after ſome few ejaculations, he began to expreſs ſincere intentions of repentance, and to become a new man, ſaying, <hi>Oh, that the Heavens would but grant this one thing, That I might always perſevere and remain in this good purpoſe of Life, I ſhould never ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my ſelf as to do thoſe things, which I am now ſenſible tend to eternal deſtruction. But,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41556:73"/>
alas! what remedy? or, what helps my bare and ſimple wiſh, my time is paſt, and I am now bound to go on a long journey, for which to my grief I am unprepared.</hi> More he indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to ſpeak but could not for weeping. Which, with theſe expreſſions pleas'd her to the heart, hoping for the future, to enjoy a peaceable life, with our new Convert: and ſeeing him in ſuch a perplexity began to drive the thing out of his head, and aſſured him that he was ſtill alive, and that he had perhaps been in a Trance, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been for a happy warning, and to make him ſenſible of his condition and of the ſtate he was in, by ſuffering himſelf to be ſo drawn aſide with ill company, and letting looſe the reins of his luſt and libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous propenſity, which every man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to by nature, and the like. But ſay what ſhe could, he could hardly beleeve but that the thing was real, and that he had verily been tormented, for it was already high light day, and he in his perfect ſenſes, yet had ſtill the wounds about him; and to be ſhort he became for the time a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit, and fully reſolved with himſelf, to be more circumſpect in his actions, and never again to bath in the Sea of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> leſt he ſhould chance to drown in the Abyſs of <hi>Pluto:</hi> and ſo effectual was this mean hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> altho his own wife (who before
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41556:73"/>
had work enough to reſtrain him) had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him Wine, he would not ſo much as once taſt it; nay, ſo abominable was it to him that he could neither endure to ſee or ſmell it: his Toſſing off whole Bowls, was now turned to a nauſeous Vomiting, and the charming Delights of good liquor changed into a deteſtable and loathſom Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency.</p>
            <p>Five full years continued this paſſage in great privacy, before <hi>Ambroſe</hi> diſcover'd the Trick, for it was done with the knowledge of too many perſons to be always conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or held under the Roſe: at what time (by I know not what pick-thank) he was informed how his wife with the help of ſome others, had deluded him; which nevertheleſs his fury was in ſome manner too ſtrong for him to bridle, yet being ſenſible of what he had confeſſed at the whipping poſt, he held faſt the Rains of his wrath, leſt he ſhould be twitted of his belluin acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and had by that time ſo learned to lord over his paſſions, that he rather thought it his duty to content himſelf with the effects of that machin, how unkindly ſoever he might take it from their hands who had been the cauſe of this his odd Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Amſterdamnable Guſman</hi> having once in his life <hi>done evil that good came of it,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41556:74"/>
met once ſuddenly again with another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do himſelf good, which was on this wiſe:</p>
            <p>Not long after this Maſquerade he applies himſelf to an eminent Merchant of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> whoſe chief Traffic was in the <hi>Straits</hi> and at <hi>Greenland,</hi> whither he ſent every year ſeveral Ships: of this ſame Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant he bought, to the value of 3600. gilders in Train and Whale-bone, beſides 800. gilders in Rice, which he promiſed to pay upon delivery, for which purpoſe he repairs to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>vander Ha—</hi> the ſaid Merchant, with a bag of money, where the Goods were delivered. <hi>Diomedes</hi> tender'd him the money, amounting to 4400. gilders, for which the Merchant ſigns an acquittance. Now <hi>Diomedes</hi> in the mean time had a Camrade of his by him all the time, whom he had inſtructed in what he was to do. Seeing now his opportunity, he calls the Merchant aſide, as if he had an earneſt to impart to him, where he held him up with an invented ſtory, while the other clandeſtinly takes up the bags and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, and ſteals away.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſaw all effected he walks demutely back again with the Merchant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Counting houſe, where the Merchant coming ſees the Money and Paper gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rage and ſtamp like mad, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41556:74"/>
what to do in the caſe, but at laſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind, ſuch another prank <hi>Diomedes</hi> had play'd, of which ſome had given him an inkling, immediatly without more ado charges the matter home upon him, and tax'd him for the Thief. <hi>Diomedes</hi> highly incenſed at the affront began to give him ſcurvy language, which was again reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated; in ſhort to high words they came, and finally <hi>Diomedes</hi> gave him a challenge, which Mr. <hi>vander Ha—</hi> refuſed not to anſwer, ſo to't they went, where <hi>Diomedes,</hi> being an experter ſword-man, gave him a prick under the left pap, which he judging to be mortal, took him to his heels, and away for <hi>Paris,</hi> to avoid the danger that was incumbent on him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>vander Ha—</hi> in the mean while lies wallowing in his blood, is found by ſome who knew him and brought home, three Chirurgeons are immediatly ſent for, who having made inſpection into the wound, concluded the good Gentleman paſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; however uſe their utmoſt diligence to cure him, and at laſt by their joint care and skill, brought him ſo far up, that he was judged paſt all danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> who knew no better but that his Antagoniſt was dead, kept himſelf very privatly at <hi>Paris,</hi> till all his money was ſpent for by reaſon of his ſudden departure, he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41556:75"/>
could not take more with him than a litle gold he had in his pocket. Seeing now that all his money was gone, he reſolves to liſt himſelf among a company of Padders, having already got into acquaintance with a Captain of the Gang, who upon his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation gave him free admiſſion, with this proviſo, That he ſhould firſt ſhow his proof by way of Tryal, or <hi>examen,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now by reaſon of the unhappy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he had involved himſelf into, he went under the name of Monſr. <hi>de Villeneuf,</hi> which name we purpoſe to make uſe of to denote his Worſhip in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Monſr. <hi>de Villeneuf</hi> went into a noted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, where ſeveral of the young Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity did cuſtomarily meet once a week, where being come, and looking like a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of no indifferent quality, ſat himſelf down among thoſe Gentlemen, and being in the croud, when they firſt began to take their places, none took occaſion to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion how he came there; for beſides their civility for the better convenience of the Houſe, ſtrangers are admitted at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Landlord, every one thought he might probably be an acquaintance of ſome one in the company, and therefore unwilling to put any affront upon him, not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41556:75"/>
knowing whoſe diſpleaſure that they might incur by ſo doing. To come more to the matter, Monſr. <hi>de Villeneuf,</hi> obſerves, when (as the manner of that Ordinary is) the Gueſts gave money into a ſilver Charger for the uſe of the Poor, which went round the Table; that a Gentleman who ſat at his right hand had a velvet Purſe well charged with Piſtols: This Purſe made his Teeth to water, and like a Load-ſtone had ſuch an attractive vertue that it turn'd his eye what wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Meal was over the Gentleman roſe from Table, and took his leave of the company. Monſr. <hi>de Villeneuf</hi> ſeeing him go, poſts away after him, to ſee if he could bring his purpoſe about, and accordingly cloſes up with him, ſaying; <q>Sir, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by your diſcourſe at Table, that you have a deſire to buy two Coach-horſes, There is an acquaintance of mine, who has a brace of Flanders-Mares, which if you have a mind to ſee I will give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that he may wait upon you, at what time and place you are pleaſed to appoint. Monſr. <hi>de Molineaux</hi>
               </q> (for that was the Gentlemans name) hearing him ſay ſo, made anſwer? <q>Sir, 'tis true, I have 4, or 5 days inquired but cannot hear of any according to my mind, and if you can bring me to ſight of thoſe two Mares, you

will infinitly oblige me, yet believe me, Sir, I ſhould be loath to put you to ſo great a trouble; but wherein I may ſerve you, vouchſafe but to command and your injunction ſhall be obey'd.</q> 
               <hi>Villeneuf</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that it was no more than his duty to ſerve him, the more becauſe his ſuppoſed acquaintance had deſired him to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his bargain: and ſo pray'd him to go along with him to a Cabaret hard by, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to ſend for his friend thither. To this <hi>Molineaux</hi> aſſents; where being come <hi>Villeneuf</hi> writes to his Comrades, under no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of writing about what he had intimated to <hi>Molineaux.</hi> After he had done he ſtept aſide to give it a Boy who was to carry it, according to his directions. The ſenſe of the Letter was thus:</p>

            </p>
            <p>The note was larger but abſtruſe: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſo perſpicuous to them as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his meaning, and accordingly came; one repreſenting an Officer of Juſtice, the

So ſoon as they came in, they ſiezed the perſon of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineaux,</hi> in preſence of <hi>Villeneuf</hi> who made as if he had been mightily aſtoniſhed at the matter, and ſhow'd himſelf greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for him, deſiring them not to be ſo uncivil as to drag a Gentleman out of the houſe at that rate. Monſr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> prays them to tell him what was the matter, and upon what account they arreſted him, with all deſiring them to adviſe the matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, and bethink themſelves, whether he was the perſon, or no, that they came to look for. The Officer with a dreadful look tells him, that he, and none elſe, was the Perſon they looked for, <hi>Come, come,</hi> added he, <hi>you would pretend ignorance, would you?</hi> are not you acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch and ſuch men [naming ſome of an infamous gang, and himſelf for one] and are you ignorant of ſuch and ſuch a cheat? Monſr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> ſwore and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he never was acquainted with that gang of Rogues, neither did he know any thing of thoſe cheats. However notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe aſſeverations, the Officer commanded the men to ty him faſt, as they would have done, only <hi>Villeneuf</hi> prays them that he might have the liberty to ſpeak a word with him apart, to which the Officer gave his conſent. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> therefore calls

him aſide and diſcourſes him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <q>Sir, I cannot enough condole your preſent trouble into which you are fallen, but if I can be Bail for you, I will, rather than that you ſhould be carried through the ſtreets, which may tend to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, well knowing (although my acquaintance with you has not been long) that you are a Perſon of ſuch worth, as that you cannot but be univerſally known, only I deſire to have ſome ſecurity for my ſelf, which if I ſhould demand upon ſuch an account I hope you will not take ill out, ſince you have that by you, which will do it.</q> Monſr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> thanks him for his great civility, withal telling him that he was content, and pray'd him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Purſe of Gold if that would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy him. <q>Well (replies <hi>Villeneuf,)</hi> I hope that the matter will not prove ſo difficult after they find it a miſtake, and I queſtion not on the other hand (ſince the Officer knows me) but that he will accept of my Bail;</q> and with that ſteps toward him, and offered his Bail. At firſt he ſeems to ſcruple, ſaying, that he knew not whether he might do it or not with ſafety; <q>But, <hi>added he,</hi> for the honour of you Monſr. <hi>Villeneuf,</hi> I am content to hazard the matter, being you ſeem to have knowledge of him.</q> 
               <hi>Villeneuf</hi> having promiſed upon his <hi>parole</hi> to

make him forth-coming, the mock-Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble took his leave of him and went out, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them two together.</p>
            <p>When they were gone <hi>Villeneuf</hi> began to ask him, what was the matter? to whom the Gentleman replies, that he knew no more what it was than of his Deaths-day, but that he was ſure it was a miſtake. <q>If I might be ſure of that, <hi>(quoth he)</hi> I would go my ſelf and diſcourſe the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer about it, for albeit I am ſatisfied as to your being wrong'd, yet people you know are always apter to ſuſtain and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a bad opinion of any man, than a good, and the whiteſt walls we ſee are the ſooneſt ſtain'd.</q> To be brief, he deſired him to ſtay a litle and he would go and ſpeak with him, and if he did not return within an hour, that he ſhould go to ſuch a Cabaret in St. <hi>Honory</hi> ſtreet, and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for him, which Monſr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> promiſed to do. <hi>Villeneuf</hi> in the mean time, goes to his Comrades and tells them that at ſuch a time, he was to bring him a ſum of money for his ſecurity, naming when and where, which was the ſame time and place he thought they would find the Gentleman, praying them to meet him at that time there. This done <hi>Villain-enough</hi> trips off and went for <hi>Rouan,</hi> where he imbarques himſelf for <hi>Middleburg,</hi> having got 800. and

            <p>Monſr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> whom he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind beginning too late to diſtruſt the Cheat, reſolves with himſelf to go out and ſee if he could hear of <hi>Villeneuf,</hi> but the Landlord, ſeeing him offer to go forth, takes him by the ſhoulder and bad him pay before he went, which he was fain to do. Coming to the Houſe where <hi>Villeneuf</hi> had appointed him, he inquired for him: but not hearing of him, and he now waited a good while for him, began to diſtruſt the matter, and at laſt makes his mind known to the Landlady of the Houſe; who imparted the matter to her Husband, her Husband to other Friends then in the Houſe, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it to be a Cheat. Whilſt they were buſy in talking, comes the Fellow who had plaid the Officer, and five or ſix of the gang with him, and asked for <hi>Villeneuf.</hi> The Landlady knew that was the name of the Bail, and pray'd them to go up to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſtairs, which they did, but entring the Room they found that they had got a wrong Sow by the tail, and would have run out again, but the Man of the Houſe ſhut to the ſtreet door, and would not ſuffer them; till having ſent for an Officer, they were apprehended, and committed to Priſon, where they remained till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Trial in the criminal Chamber.

This Gentleman ſeeing <hi>Diomedes</hi> poſted after him as faſt as he could, taking two friends along with him who were well mounted, and juſt then upon a journey for <hi>Flanders,</hi> for which reaſon the Mercer was to convoy them a part of the way. So ſoon as <hi>Diomedes</hi> with the paſſage Boat arrives at <hi>Haarlem,</hi> the Mercer follows him to ſee where he would go in, and there arreſted him.

               <hi>Diomedes</hi> in the mean while, goes to his Debtor, whom he found not at home, and was fain for that time to be content. But bethinking himſelf of a ſum he had ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at <hi>Amersfoort,</hi> he betakes himſelf thither.</p>
            <p>Coming into a certain Village near the City he takes up his lodging there, for he having once play'd a foul Trick at <hi>Amers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foort,</hi> durſt not venture himſelf in the Town, but ſent a note to the Perſon who ought him the money, praying to ſpeak with him. The man received his Letter,

ſent him anſwer that he would come, as the day following he did, being come <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> prays him that he would pleaſe to pay the money: But the man who was not in a capacity to pay it, pray'd him, to have patience 14 days and he would pay him the moſt part of the ſum. <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeemed very unwilling, but knowing that he durſt not ſue him, becauſe of the bad circumſtances he was under, which, if he had made the leſt ſtir or appearance would have turn'd to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and on the other hand, was ſenſible how caſes ſtood at home, reſolves to content himſelf with his promiſe, and ſpend that time in the Village. He called briskly for wine and was attended after the beſt manner, till his money was up. When the 14 days were expired, he ſends to his Debtor at <hi>Amersfoort</hi> who pray'd him to ſtay a week longer for his money, and he would faithfully pay him all, giving him ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and probable reaſons, whence he might gather that there was ſome apparency of reality in the man. <hi>Diomedes,</hi> though ſore againſt his will, was fain to take all in good part, for the aforeſaid reaſons, and when the time came about, he ſends again but word was brought him that his Debtor was march'd of and had taken all his moveables with him, which ſo vex'd <hi>Diomedes,</hi> that he was ready to hang himſelf, that he ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41556:80"/>
be ſo chouc'd with the man, and beſides his tedious journey; to run himſelf into debt at his Lodging. Every time <hi>Diomedes</hi> roſe from Table, his Landlady look'd for her money; who ſeeing nothing come but a few airy Caſtles, at laſt aſſumed the boldneſs to ask him when he thought to pay her, <hi>Diomedes</hi> told her that the next day he would receive ſome money for a bargain of Wine he had ſold to a Vintner, and upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of that money he would pay her. She diſtruſting, the rather becauſe he ſent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral Letters, to &amp; from <hi>Amersfoort,</hi> contented her ſelf with that anſwer. The next day, the Landlady perceiving him to deal in Wine, pray'd him to ſhow her the way to purify Claret; <hi>Diomedes</hi> gives her ſome inſtructions in writing, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted coſt himſelf a great deal of money in <hi>France.</hi> He told her beſides that he had a way of making one Pipe or Veſſel yield two ſorts of Wine; as by example, If it be a Hogshead of white Wine that it would run both white and claret from the ſame Veſſel, at two ſeveral Cocks, as diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent both in taſt and colour, as if it were two ſorts of Wine. The Landlady prays him to teach her that art, ſaying that ſhe was a poor woman, and burthened with a charge of children, and by her late Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands negligence brought into ſo much

The evening being come, The Landlady ſends out the Maid on a ſleevleſs errand, which ſhe thought would coſt her an hour or two at leſt; <hi>Diomedes</hi> provides himſelf with an auger to pierce the Cask, and a paper or two of Powders, which muſt be the Ingredients, and ſo calling his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady into the Cellar falls a boring: when he had bored one hole, he pray'd the Woman to ſet her thumb to it till he had bored ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which when he had done, cries out, <hi>Good lack a day, what have I forgot? the main Ingredient I have left ſome where in my Chamber, which is the firſt that I muſt uſe,</hi> and ſo pray'd the Landlady to ſtop the other hole ſo long with her other thumb which ſhe did. <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing her ſo hard inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at ſtopping, marches ſoftly up ſtairs into his Chamber, takes his Port-mantle, and

ruminating the Houſe finds a Bag of money which was left to the care of the Landlady by a Butcher who was come to buy Cattel at the Beaſt-market, and ſo trips off. The Landlady being thus imploy'd waited a while with patience till ſhe grew weary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to cry out, <hi>Where are you, Sir, if you ſtay much longer, the Maid will come.</hi> But no anſwer was made, ſhe then calls out again, a ſecond and a third time, ſtill receiving no anſwer; whereupon ſhe began to ſmell a Cheat, and fain would ſhe go to ſee for him but could not leave the Cask: and in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſhe was fain to ſtay till her Maid comes home, who wondred to ſee her Miſtreſs faſt to the Cask, ask'd her, what was the matter? <hi>Pre'thee</hi> Nan <hi>ſays the old Woman, ſet your thumbs to theſe two holes, till I go above;</hi> The Maid relieves the Miſtreſs, and the Miſtreſs runs in all haſt up ſtairs, to ſee for her Gueſt, but entring his room, finds him not, and going into another, ſees her Linnen and other Goods all on a heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cries out with a lamentable voice, <hi>Theeves, Theeves, I am undon, I am rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, I am undon, all I have in the world is ſtole.</hi> The Maid hearing her ſay ſo, forgets her ſelf and in all haſt runs up alſo, to ſee, if her new Petticoat and Linnen were not ſtole likewiſe. The Woman runs up and down the Houſe like one diſtracted, the more

            <p>About three days after <hi>Diomedes</hi> arrives it <hi>Utrecht,</hi> it being then Horſe-Fair, takes up his Lodging at an eminent Inn, not far from the Cathedral Church, and met acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally with a young Gentleman who was a Canonic, or <hi>Dom Heer</hi> of that Place, and come thither to receive his annual Prebend. When they ſate together at ſupper <hi>Diomedes</hi> inſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next day the Gentleman prays <hi>Diomedes</hi> to accompany him to the Fair, and (ſince two heads are alwayes better then one) deſired his help and judgement about a Horſe. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> to ſhow that he was a man of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, could not be ſo uncivil as to deny him and ſo accordingly they went together. After they had view'd the Fair well, the <hi>Dom-Heer,</hi> ſpies one to which he took a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular liking, being both of a neat ſhape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind, and likewiſe an excellent ambler. The Horſe he bought paying to the value of 45. pound <hi>ſterl.</hi> for him, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be brought to the Inn, where he lay, and returns with <hi>Diomedes</hi> home, where
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41556:82"/>
by that time he came, the Horſe was brought, and ſet up in the ſtable. The next day the Gentleman asks <hi>Diomedes</hi> if he would break his faſt with him, to which he eaſily aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when they had done, called for a reckoning, the <hi>Dom-Heer</hi> ſadles his Gelding and makes himſelf ready for a journey. <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing him lay on a heavy Port-mantle behind him, thought it more than a venial offence to looſe ſuch a conſiderable booty, told him he would bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany part of the way, if he would pleaſe to have the patience ſo long till he had hired a Horſe, willing rather to ride, having ſuch a civil Gentleman for his Fellow-traveller, than to ſit in the Paſſage-boat ſuch fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among a company of old wives. The Canonic was glad to have his fellowſhip, I told him he would ſtay for him, <hi>Diomedes</hi> immediately goes to a Hackney ſtable; where he, with the recommendation of the Landlord, hires an old Jade that could hardly trail her leggs after her. This done they both mount, and ſo ſoon as they were got out of the Town, the <hi>Dom-Heer</hi> new phangled of his purchaſe, rides out to try his Gelding, which done, he prays <hi>Diomedes</hi> to diſmount, and try him, which he alſo did, and let the <hi>Dom-Heer</hi> ride ſo long on his old Hackney. <hi>Diomedes</hi> now mounted on the Gelding rides a good way forward,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41556:82"/>
and honeſtly returns again, and ſo a ſecond time a litle further, returning likewiſe. The Gentleman taking more delight to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ride his Horſe than himſelf, prays him to ride off again, which he did, and that ſo far that he never ſaw him ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> after he had left his Companion and provided himſelf, of a good horſe and money enough was reſolved to take a turn up towards <hi>Aix la Chapel</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> and accordingly went through <hi>Brabant,</hi> where he play'd ſome notable Pranks, one whereof was thus.</p>

            <p>On a certain morning came in ſo many of his Creditors that the entry of his houſe was full, which he underſtanding called in ſome of the Principle of them into a Room apart where he opened a Cheſt of Drawers and ſhow'd them ſeveral Baggs of Money and aſked what for coin they would be pai'd in; they made anſwer, ſo as he pleaſed. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Gentlemen be content for this

time to go away, and come to-morrow and I ſhall in the mean time take it into conſideration.</hi> With this anſwer they were fain to depart; but coming the next day found him ſtill in the ſame Story: For he ever let them ſee the Land of Promiſe, but would never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to enter into it. Theſe being moſtly Perſons of mechanical Profeſſions could not endure any longer to be balked, but reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to proceed againſt him at law, and ſee if that would be more effectual than Threats and Flatteries.</p>
            <p>Soon after comes <hi>Leopoldus</hi> from the <hi>Hague</hi> who had ſold him 12000. gl. in Actions, and the Ship-Carpenter who had pretence of 4666 <hi>gl.</hi> upon him, the Corn-Merchant <hi>Ierome</hi> to whom he was owing 69160 <hi>gl,</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> who came in for 82000 gl. more; theſe all unanimouſly went and made their Addreſs to the Upper-Judge, who hearing theſe various complaints, could not but add credit to their Demonſtrations, they being Perſons of that worth, and Gentlemen of honeſt Fame; inſomuch that theſe Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities made Diomedes ſo black, that the Officer of Juſtice could not but take notice of him as a great Criminal as well for Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Forging of Writings, &amp;c. as for Fighting and Bloodſhed, with many ſuch like abuſes: Inſomuch that he watched his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to apprehend him and commit him
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41556:85"/>
to cuſtody having already an old claim againſt him for a delinquency already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. <hi>Diomedes</hi> beginning to <hi>ſmell a Ratt,</hi> thought good to pack up his Auls and be gone, taking with him 10000 <hi>gild.</hi> in Gold and about 36000 <hi>gild.</hi> in Jewels, which he had to that end bought to ſupply himſelf in time of need: beſides 18000 <hi>gild.</hi> in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Jewels which he hid ſome where about Haarlem, thinking that if he ſhould prove infortunate, that might be his Friend in Extremity. This done lie poſts away through <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and ſo on for <hi>Middleburg,</hi> where he took up his lodging in an Inn, thinking there to reſt a litle after a weariſom Journey.</p>
            <p>He had with him only one Perſon to wait upon him, who ſpoke very good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> judging him as ſerviceable upon his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Journey, which was for <hi>England.</hi> His whole purpoſe he imparts to <hi>Harry</hi> (for that was his mans name) and what his reſolution was: <hi>Harry</hi> in the mean time (haveing acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with <hi>Leopold's</hi> Page) writes to him and detects the whole concern; the Page thought it his duty to intimate the matter to his maſter, ſhows him the Letter. <hi>Leopold</hi> upon this notice went with all poſſible ſpeed for <hi>Middleburg,</hi> where <hi>Diomedes</hi> lay wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and charges the Pretor or Baliff of the Town with him, who went inſtantly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41556:86"/>
with the <hi>Dienaers</hi> and ſiezed him, being ſo drunk that he was not able to ſtand; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they were fain to arreſt a Fellow with a wheel-barrow to carry him along, which after they had firſt made him faſt, they did, being guarded by hundreds of the Rabble, and an infinite Train of Boys, who were very inquiſitive what the matter was that ſuch a Gallant ſhould be ſo meanly coached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> all this while was not ſenſible whither they brought him, being ſo drunk that he had not the uſe of his ſences. Thus hurried away, he was put into a Dungeon where having got a little Sleep he awaked; and not knowing any thing of the matter could not deviſe where he was got, for all was dark. In this amazement he began to grope here and there, where ſtill he could feel nothing but the bare Walls, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about him could not ſee any thing, which made him doubt whether he were blind, or that it came by the vigorous effects of the Wine. At laſt he began to cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the more he cried the worſe perplexed he was, for no anſwer was made. Thus remaining in a quandary a thouſand doubts and Imaginations poſſeſſed his mind, till at length he falls aſleep again and ſo remained till it was day, at what time he diſcovered by the light of a litle hole that he was for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41556:86"/>

But all this time he could hardly perſuade him ſelf that the thing was real, but would fain impoſe upon his thoughts that he only dream'd, and that it was a meer Fantaſy occaſioned from the Threats, of thoſe he had gull'd at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> This continued for ſome time till at laſt he ſaw clearly there was no deception in the caſe, but that he was ſurely faſt. His negligence he relented now more than his Actions, which were the occaſion of this his miſery, and the loſs of his money vex'd him more than that of his Reputation: but ſeeing that Repentance was now an hour too late, and all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to no purpoſe, he begins to hunt out for a place to make his eſcape by.

Theſe he offered the Jaylors man that brought him meat; but he conſidering that his place was of more conſideration than the Jewels (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the judgement he had) and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41556:87"/>
the Penalty greater than both, he durſt not hearken to him leſt he ſhould be tempted, inſomuch that <hi>Diomedes</hi> grew deſperate of ever coming out that way, and was fain to comfort himſelf on the beſt wiſe he could and with hopes of Mercy.</p>
            <p>After a few days he came to Tryal, and found that his Creditors were all acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Condition, and had made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to have him brought to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> amongſt whom the Head-Officer of that City principally appeared, that there he might receive his condign puniſhment according to the enormous feats he had committed there, and therefore moſt fitting there to be a public Example. <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, in Court, denies all, and was thereupon remanded back to priſon till further and clearer proof could be made, by Wittneſſes of <hi>Affidavits</hi> from <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Being now ſecured the ſecond time, his greateſt fear was that thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> would prevail in their Demands, and get him thither, where he being palpably guilty of ſo many enormities would hardly come off with his life, or that perhaps coming to have a ſecond hearing, caſes would appear ſo dirty that he might for better ſecurity be clapt into ſhakles, and have a pair of Iron garters beſtowed upon him; reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to looſe no time or opportunity, nor

Many Croſs-pipes and conveyances he found, but either he could not find an Entry, or elſe the muſſin too narrow to receive his body: however, the hardeſt Invention is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable, and nothing ſo difficult, but may be accompliſhed by Time, Patience and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.

After a long pinching and ſqueeſing of his body, in he goes, and found it ever wider and wider till he got up ſo high that he could teach the ſeat, where groping to find the hole, feeled a pair of warm Buttocks, which happened to be a Gentlewoman, who was newly ſet.

            <p>But amids all theſe hopes he received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Spain</hi> that the Ship which he had ſent out upon a hopefull voyage was caſt away on the heighth of <hi>Cabo Verdo,</hi> which news reduced him to deſpair, inſomuch that he continually ran from one Tavern to another, and miſpent his time, that with an inceſſant conſumption of money made his wife in a worſe humor than before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:41556:96"/>
It happened not long after that he met with an expert Gameſter at Backgammon who allured him to play a Game with him to paſs away the time. <hi>Diomedes</hi> who in his days had now and then ſhaken his arm, was eaſily moved to it; ſo to't they went; where from Shillings they proceeded to Ducatoons, and from Ducatoons to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, <hi>Diomedes</hi> in the mean time holding the board eaven with his Antagoniſt, which was done by ſubtility to make <hi>Diomedes</hi> the more eaſily induced to venture upon greater ſums. At laſt it came up to 25 <hi>gild.</hi> (or 50 <hi>ſh.)</hi> a throw, ſo that <hi>Diomedes</hi> came off at night with 1300 <hi>gild.</hi> loſs. And being willing to go home, his Party takes him by the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and would not let him ſtirr out of the place till he had given him a Bond under his hand, whereby he acknowled himſelf to be indebted ſo much money to his Party, and thereby firmly binding himſelf to pay it upon demand. <hi>Diomedes</hi> was at firſt very loath to ſet his hand to paper, but ſeeing no remedy he was forced to it.</p>
            <p>The next morning betimes came the Gentleman and demanded his Money of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> before his wife was ſtirring; upon which <hi>Diomedes</hi> went privately and ſtole away the Keys, <hi>Olympia</hi> not once percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for ſhe was faſt aſleep, not having ſlept the whole night by reaſon of her huſbands
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41556:97"/>
ſtaying late out; for whom ſhe was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fear, knowing him to be of a raſh and reſolute temper when he had drunk a litle more than ordinary. Having now got the Keys he took out a bag of moneys very clandeſtinely, pays his Creditor and lays the Keys where he took them.</p>
            <p>Whem <hi>Olympia</hi> had occaſion for ſome moneys went up into her Cheſt and found a great hole in the Caſh, falls aboard her huſband and called him a thouſand Rogues, which he by all the means he could indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extenuate, but all to no purpoſe for he had not the art to tame a Shrew. All the ways he could poſſibly think upon he made uſe of to pacifie, and flattered her with promiſes of Amendment, and I know not what. Still <hi>Olympia</hi> rails and curſes the day that ever ſhe ſaw him, wiſhing ſhe had been in her Coffin when ſhe ſat upon the houſe of Office, or that Death had ſeized upon her Heart, when he ſeized upon her Breach, &amp;c. Thus ſhe continued for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this fume, and would not go to bed with him, no, nor eat in his preſence. Long dured this feud between them altho he for his part did all he could to compoſe the Difference, which in proceſs of time he accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The money being now brought to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt he began to ſolicit for more, which he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41556:97"/>
would raiſe by expoſing ſome Linnen to public ſale, which converted into money, he told her he had a conceit in his head to put them well in ſtock again; <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> was not ſo raſh of beleef as he had hopes ſhe would be, before he made the over tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and moved the matter; well knowing it was by no laudable, but ſome dishonourable practiſe.</p>
            <p>Day by day he wrought upon her, till he made her weary almoſt of life, and, was at laſt forced to give her Conſent: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained, he went to the Public Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man [or Out-crier] and delivers him the Goods.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had got the moneys, he went to a Merchant who dealt in Linnens by Whole-ſale, and told him, that whereas he had bought ſeveral Pieces of him, and not paid for the ſame, he was come to pay off the Accompt, according to his Duty, <hi>Sir,</hi> replies the Merchant, I <hi>know nothing of the matter, pray what is your name? I ſhall ſee in my Journal. My name,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is</hi> D. de Lebec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41556:98"/>
and the ſum, but not to the time, for he had only noted it negligently in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket book without any certain date. Still the merchant declines it, and declared how unwilling he was to receive moneys which he doubted whether it belonged to him or no, and that it might probably be ſome other perſon, and that the miſtake mightly there. <hi>Diomedes</hi> aſſures him on the contrary, ſaying that certainly he was the man. Many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were uſed on both ſides, and at laſt it was brought to this concluſion, that they ſhould caſt a lot, and ſo end the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that way; which they did, and it fell upon <hi>Diomedes</hi> to pay the money, upon which he told him 160 <hi>gild.</hi> Which he ſaid was the ſum, this being don, the Old Merchant invites <hi>Diomedes</hi> to a glaſs of Wine. When they were grown a litle merry, they ſtruck a bargain for 6090 <hi>gild.</hi> in Linnen, whereof he was to tender 1000 <hi>gild.</hi> in ready money, and the remainder in 3 moneths, with which the old Gentleman was well ſatisfied, not in the leaſt diſtruſting any guile in his new Cuſtomer, for that he had already ſhown himſelf a well meaning juſt man. <hi>Diomedes</hi> having got the Linnen, brought it home and furniſhed his ſhop in better manner than it ever had been before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Olympia</hi> ſeeing all theſe Goods brought home was more poſſeſſed with fear than joy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41556:98"/>
ſuſpecting it was brought about by ſome unjuſt mean or other, and would at laſt prove a bitter bargain. Often times ſhe indeavoured to underſtand from him whence it came and upon what conditions he had bought it, which nevertheleſs he would not let her know. However ſhe never deſiſted to admoniſh him of leaving off his unjuſt courſes, withall telling him what would be the end of it: but all to litle purpoſe, for he was deaf on that ear: and as Guil and ſiniſter dealings ſeldom ever make a man real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, ſo it rendred him very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as will appear in theſe following Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It happened not long after that <hi>Diomedes</hi> met with a perſon that every way ſuited his drift and humor who was likewiſe a Blade of Fortune. This Gentleman deſirous to ſhow <hi>Diomedes</hi> a trick went into <hi>North-Holland,</hi> where he hired a Lighter, to go for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and arriving there he applies himſelf to <hi>Diomedes</hi> deſiring to buy ſome Linnen, and pretended he came expreſly upon that account from <hi>Hoorn,</hi> and in caſe he would uſe him kindly in what he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, he would be a conſtant Cuſtomer to him. <hi>Diomedes</hi> thereupon promiſes he would deal fairly with him, and affoard him as good or better Penny-worths than any Linnen-Draper in the City, upon which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41556:99"/>
he ſhow'd him ſeveral ſorts of Linnen and rich Silks. In ſum he made a bargain with him for ſeveral pieces, which he pray'd him that he would help him to Ship, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> did, <hi>Herman</hi> (for that was the Cuſtomers name) having given him a Glaſs of Wine, or two, at laſt prevails with him to go down with him to <hi>Hoorn</hi> where he would pay him the Money, and crave his Aſſiſtance in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ordering of the Shop. <hi>Diomedes</hi> not willing to diſoblige ſuch a hopefull Cuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So ſoon as they were arrived at <hi>Hoorn, Diomedes</hi> ſteps with him out of the Lighter ſuppoſing he would bring him to his houſe and with one pay him his Money. After they had gone through ſeveral ſtreets <hi>Harman</hi> brings him into an empty houſe which he had taken for a year only to that end and purpoſe. The houſe was without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture than only a ſtool or two, an old Table and a few planks. Entring the houſe they were welcomed by a Perſon who was privy to the matter, whom <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſuppoſed to be his Brother. <hi>Diomedes</hi> is deſired to ſit down and a Glaſs of Wine is brought fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Diomedes</hi> to keep himſelf company, mad, all the haſt they could to get the Lighter which having got, they ſet ſail, &amp; with a ſtiff gale preſently got out of ſight.</p>

               <hi>Diomedes</hi> all this time waits for his Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, but having ſitten above half an hour, and finding they did not come he began to miſtruſt ſome Knavery, and on a ſudden runs up ſtairs and into every Room in the houſe, where he ſaw no body. After he had ruminated the whole houſe through, he went in all haſt to the Haven where the Lighter came on, which by reaſon of the many croſs ſtreets and by-lanes they led him thro, he had much ado to find: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the very Place he found the Lighter was gone; upon which in all haſt he returns back again to the houſe and enquires of the Neighbours whoſe it was, and what his name was that had taken it, the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At this <hi>Diomedes</hi> was ſtartled, and in all haſt runs to the Landlord, and aſks him, Where the Perſon lived that had taken his houſe. The Landlord replied that he knew him not, for he had never ſeen him before, whence <hi>Diomedes</hi> gathered that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>He gave order to apprehend ſuch a Perſon, if he ſhould be ſeen or appear there any more,

and that notice ſhould be ſent him, and upon that returns for <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>

But all he could perſuade or do, would not move her ſo much as to take any notice of his words: inſomuch that he was fain to be patient againſt his will to hear thoſe Thunder-claps; which continued ſo long that he reſolved to take ſome enterpriſe or other in hand to put himſelf yet once more into ſtock.</p>
            <p>He ſends an old Woman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to a Salesman to buy up a Quakers Suit, with a plain hat, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>At night he went down to the Paſſage-boat for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where he met with good company, all looking upon him as a Quaker, or an Anabaptiſt, and according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor ſimple and upright, he knowing ſo well how to manage the matter that he was univerſally taken for what he counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

            <p>After he had done with the Vanity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and the Mode-ſick Rout, he began to reprehend the Covetous Generation, laying out the ſad and lamentable effects of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and the many temptations that they were under who were addicted to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus rambling from Vertues to Vice, and from Vice to Vertues, he purchaſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a good eſteem of all the Company: and now underſtanding that they were not far from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> he proceeded to the praiſe and diſpraiſe of ſeveral Callings and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions according as they were laudable or diſcommendable in themſelves, &amp; at laſt began to treat about Merchandiſe, which he preferred above all other Vocations
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41556:101"/>
which the Sons of Men uſe, provided it be carried on and managed with upright and ſquare dealing: and by ſome by-words ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as much as that it was his proper calling.</p>
            <p>A Merchant then in the Boat that ſat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over againſt him, aſked him, In what Commodity he chiefly dealt in, he made anſwer, In Linnen and in Grain. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman upon that recommended him to a Friend of his at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> who had a good quantity of Grain which by reaſon it was, as times ſtood then, very doubtfull which way the market would turn, whether riſe or fall he might probably meet with a good Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This propoſal ſuited well with <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and being arrived at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> went with him to the other Merchants houſe, who had about 80 Laſt (or 160 Tun) in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which he ſet at 170 <hi>gild</hi> the Laſt, amounting to about 136000 <hi>gild.</hi> in all, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> objected againſt, ſaying it was too high, and prayed him to ſet a lower price with one word, retaining to himſelf a competent Gain.

ſhows it to <hi>Diomedes</hi> who ſeemed as if he were glad at the news and therefore prayd <hi>Arond</hi> (for that was the Merchants name) to go with him a litle. <hi>Arond,</hi> replies that he knew not the Perſon: <hi>How,</hi> quoth <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, do you not know him, and he knows you ſo well? Come, I ſhall find him very well.</hi> Upon this <hi>Arond</hi> goes with him, both following the Meſſenger that brought the Letter, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going to the Garner, he led them out of the Town to a Tavern, notedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous; for that the Man himſelf was a notorious Rogue, the Wife a Whore, and the Daughter one that had been ſeveral times publickly whipt upon the Scaffold. The Maſter of the houſe was before hand bribed to be aſſiſtant under ſome golden promiſes, and immediatly called out, <hi>A Rogue, A Rogue,</hi> and with that bolts the Door faſt. Immediatly upon this ſudden outcry, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> ruſhes in, who had all this time held himſelf ſo ſincere and Pious, taking a rope, ties him hand and foot, and put a Gag be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his teeth, which done they drew the door to, and left him upon the floor neither able to cry out nor move. <hi>Diomedes</hi> in the mean while whiſpers the Meſſenger in the Ear, that he ſhould acquaint the Shipmaſter how that they intended to go through Land to <hi>Sardam,</hi> and that he ſhould not neglect to fall down with the Tide, having a very fair
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41556:103"/>
wind and good weather, The man runs away and diſpatches his errand; <hi>Diomedes</hi> alſo follows him accompanied with the Maid or Daughter, who had order from her Father to go down with <hi>Diomedes</hi> (for they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the hoſt ſhould have a ſhare in the Purchaſe) <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Wench had no great liking to it; and thereupon pretends to have forgot ſomething in the Town, deſires the Maid go on ſoftly and he would overtake her, going in the mean time through another ſtreet and was brought aboard the Veſſel which had juſt ſet ſail, and told the Maſter that he had altered his reſolution and left his Affairs to Monſr. <hi>Arond</hi> to direct in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that <hi>Arond</hi> would come over Land. Thus having a briſk Gale they fell down with the Tide and came in a ſhort time to <hi>Sardam,</hi> where he took out the Grain into Lighters, and ſo away for <hi>Freezland</hi> where he reſhipt it again for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and there by the help of a Broker met with a ſpeedy market; and received 11293 <hi>guld.</hi> for the whole purchaſe, the Goods being very much damnified by Leckage, &amp;c. and the Price mightily fallen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Olympia</hi> ſeeing <hi>Diomedes</hi> bring home ſo much money was in a great perplexity, for ſhe doubted that he had not got it by fair means the more becauſe that when he went
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41556:103"/>
from home he had diſguiſed himſelf, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thinking that he had imployed her Money which ſhe had given him at ſeveral times in ſome ſecret Merchandiſe, ſhe took courage, receives the Money into her Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and after diſpoſes of a great part of it in Linnen, Silks &amp;c. wherewith ſhe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes her Shop.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this enterpriſe <hi>Olympia</hi> fell very ſick and died, leaving <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſole heir of all ſhe had in the World. <hi>Livia</hi> the Mother obſerving that <hi>Diomedes,</hi> ſince the death of his wife took no more notice of her, notwithſtanding the great Friendſhip he ſeem'd to manifeſt towards her, during the life of her Daughter, which now ſhe found to be no more than a paraſitical trick to cully his wife, and to truſt the more to his beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, if ſhe bequeathed all to him upon her death. She reſolves therefore upon a project to make her have more reſpect from him than with plain dealing ſhe was likely to acquire, well knowing his ingratitude was like that of an Aſſes foal, when it has ſucked ſo long till it be full, turns about and kicks the Dam.</p>
            <p>Every day ſhe careſſed <hi>Diomedes</hi> till ſhe ſaw him well inclined to continue friendſhip and for a mean ſum makes an agreement with him for her boarding in his houſe, which being mutually agreed upon on both ſides
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41556:104"/>
ſhe brought in a great Iron money cheſt fill'd with ſtones and other ponderous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, which he ſuppoſed to be Money, and knowing her to be old and decrepit, that ſhe was not likely to live long, and that by making much of her he might be once Maſter of that Treaſure.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as ſhe perceived that <hi>Diomedes</hi> was blinded with hopes of Inheritance, ſhe made a motion, as if ſhe would leave him and go elſewhere to be boarded, unleſs <hi>Diomedes</hi> would renew the Covenant, which ſhould be thus, That he during the time of her life ſhould give her free Lodging, Diet and other neceſſaries ſo long as ſhe lived, and after the expiration of her Life to inherit her Eſtate and Moneys. <hi>Diomedes,</hi> not willing to let her go now in her old days, thinking that the Term of her Life according to the courſe of Nature could not be, very long; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to what ſhe propoſed, and accordingly a Will was drawn, the Tenure whereof was, That <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſhould ſolely inherit all her goods whether moveable, or unmoveable, Gold, Silver, in Coin or Plate, Jewels, Moveables and Utenſils, and in ſhort all that upon her Death-bed ſhe could properly vendicate or claim as her own. To which was annexed the before mentioned Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as that ſhe ſhould during the Term of her Life have all neceſſaries provided her
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41556:104"/>
requiſite to the ſuſtenance of human bodies, or upon default of that, or full performance, that then the ſaid Will ſhould be void and of no effect. This Contract being ſigned <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> on his part neglected not to careſs her with what he could poſſibly imagin would pleaſe her, yet l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> not his old courſe of Life, to wit, Drinking, Whoring, Gaming and Cheating; which now he could do with more freedom than when the good <hi>Olympia</hi> was alive.</p>
            <p>By ſome acquaintance or other, he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that there was a Convent of <hi>French</hi> Dames, who had proſtituted themſelves for Money, where being once introduced by his ſaid acquaintance, he took the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion afterwards to go all alone, and having pitch'd upon 2 which he took moſt fancy for, he got them into a Room apart, where he treated them with whatſoever they had a mind to.</p>
            <p>Within an hour after comes in one Monſr. <hi>Melletier</hi> a <hi>German</hi> by birth, and ſometime under a Public Character at the Court of <hi>Sweden,</hi> from a potent Prince of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, till by a negligent management of his Maſters affairs he was called home, diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and detruded out of ſervice. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having two Ladies with him, deſired of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> that he might ſit in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to which <hi>Diomedes</hi> very eaſily aſſented.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41556:105"/>
Being thus admitted, they were very merry till night, which when come they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go to bed, 3 and 3 in a Room as they came in together. When <hi>Diomedes</hi> was got above he preſented his ſervice to his Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to undreſs them, but they abſolutely refuſed to do it, ſaying they could do the turn themſelves very well.</p>
            <p>When they were all unharnaſſed and in bed together <hi>Diomedes</hi> preſently found him ſelf in a miſtake, for inſtead of having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two Ladies, all the day at Table, he found he had treated a couple of beardleſs Young-men, upon which he was ſo ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that he jump'd out of Bed, but one of them held him faſt and pray'd him not to be diſmay'd ſince there was no great harm done ſave that he had miſied of his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he might ſuppoſe to be only a dream. In ſhort they fell into Dialogues with him, and expreſſed themſelves ſo plain, that he preſently underſtood of what gang they were, and at laſt concluded together to cozen or rob an eminent Mercer, and to conſult a mean by the next morning how to circumvent the Party pitch'd upon, and upon that reſolution they left off diſcourſe, leaving each other to their repoſe. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41556:105"/>
him paſtime enough till at laſt falling aſleep, two or three luſty fellows came up ſtairs and immediately clapt a great ball into his mouth, tied him hand and foot very faſt and put him in a great Baſket, which they made faſt with a Padlock, being naked and ſo hard pack'd up and bound that he could not move or ſtir, and his mouth ſo cloſe, that he could not cry out, or hardly draw his breath, but hearing that he breathed too ſtrong through the noſtrils they unlocked the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and ſtitch'd 'em up, which being done and the Baſket made faſt again, they took his Cloaths, Money, Watch, Rapier, &amp;c. and went their way.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Lebechea</hi> awakens and calls to the two Mock-Ladies tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them a project he had in his head which he thought might be well effected, which was; That they thould firſt lay out ſome moneys in Silks at the Mercers ſhop, and afterwards bring in a cheſt in which ſhould be a man, who by an artificial lock could open it on the in-ſide, and yet that it ſhould be firm without, and all under a pretence of ſome Goods. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them very well they therefore reſolved to do with him as the Tyrant <hi>Phalaris</hi> did with <hi>Perillus,</hi> put him in and make him the proof of his own ſtratagem. <hi>Diomedes</hi> was very unwilling and loath to take it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41556:106"/>
upon him but was at laſt perſwaded to ride the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, and accordingly was laid upon Cuſhions for ſoftnes ſake, that his long lying there might not prove uneaſy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vander Duſſen</hi> and <hi>Berné,</hi> (for ſo were the names of the maſked parties; went directly to the Mercers, where they looked out ſeveral Pieces of Silk, and pretended that they lived at <hi>Haarlem.</hi> In ſhort they bought to the value of about 730 <hi>Gild.</hi> in Silks, which they immediately tendered; and packt up the Goods in a cheſt, juſt ſuch another as they had put <hi>Diomedes</hi> in, and againſt the evening got a Porter to carry it away to their Lodging on a Wheel-barrow, where coming they took out the Goods and ſent <hi>Diomedes</hi> away in the Cheſt with another Porter, who knew nothing of the former. <hi>Vander Duſſen</hi> goes before and prays the Mercer that he would pleaſe to have the Goodnes for to ſet up the Cheſt in his houſe, till the next morning, they having come too late to the Boat. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ſuſpecting no ill, gave them houſe-room for the ſaid Cheſt, not willing to deny them ſo poor a Courteſy, for the money they had already beſtowed in his ſhop, and in hopes of future Cuſtome. The Mercer bids his ſervant to help the Porter in with the Cheſt and ſet it behind the Door, which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41556:106"/>
was done, and <hi>Vander Duſſen</hi> takes his leave of the Mercer and went to his companion <hi>Berne,</hi> who came with him about 10 a clock at night, at what time <hi>Diomedes</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come out of the Cheſt and unbolt the doors, as he did preciſely at that hour, they coming alſo to aſſiſt him took all the richeſt Goods out of the Shop and carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away to 2. Boats they had hired; which done they drew to the Door ſoftly and packt up the Goods in one of the Boats which was ſo full that they could hardly ſit all three, and becauſe <hi>Vander Duſſen</hi> and <hi>Berné</hi> were not well ſkilled at rowing, they let <hi>Diomedes</hi> row the Boat, which was laden, and themſelves ſate in that which was empty. By that time they had got to the Newbridge the Sluces and Waterbarrs were open, ſo that they got eaſily out to the ſtream, this being juſt by break of Day, and few or none appearing upon the Y, but growing more clear they eſpied a Boat at a pretty diſtance which ſeemed to make towards them, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> would perſwade them was the <hi>Schout,</hi> and therefore pray'd them to change Oars with him ſeeing his were not ſo good as theirs, and his Boat very deep loaden. They reached him theirs but in ſtead of delivering his, he thruſt them into the Goods, and row'd away, leaving them to the favour of the wind and Tide, to drive which way they would;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41556:107"/>
in ſum <hi>Diomedes</hi> got quickly out of ſight, and ſo away for <hi>North-Holland</hi> where he got a Lighter and out them aboard bringing them up to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> again, where he ſoon got a private Cuſtomer that took them off his hands: and as for <hi>Vander Duſſen</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> he was ſure they would not detect him being equally lyable to puniſhment with him, and under the ſame circumſtances.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day that this work was firſt put in practiſe was <hi>Meletier,</hi> that was packt up in a Baſket againſt his will, ſent to <hi>Utrecht</hi> with the Ordinary Market-boat; ſuperſcribed,

            <p>A few weeks after this it happened that <hi>Livia,</hi> Mother in Law to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> began to grow ſick, which was to him the occaſion of ſome joy, hoping in ſhort to live in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

when ſhe had her perfect health ſhe could not eat, inſomuch that ſhe ended her days in miſery, no ſooner was ſhe departed but <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſtrips her and lays her out; ſent alſo to ſome of his Creditors, who had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be too haſty with him, letting them know that within 3 or 4 days he would pay them their Money in full, and deſires them but to have the Patience, till the Corps was buried. He provided alſo his houſe of more ſervants, and conſidered with himſelf where he might have a Coach and Horſes, as alſo a Yacht: in ſhort the calculation he made of his Patrimony was very large, and never to be conſumed. Impoſſible it was for him to wait for his Mothers interrment before he muſt be peeping into the Cheſt, but could not find the Keys; for thoſe ſhe well ſecured in her life time, leſt at any time her ſtratagem ſhould prove ineffectual and fail her: however in turning up the Bed-ſtraw they found them between two planks, but ſo ruſty that they were hardly ſufficient for the uſe they were made for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lebechea</hi> having now got the Keys he made a ſhift to get the cheſt open, which he found ſtow'd with ſtones and Cannon-bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets (for her deceaſed Huſband was the Gunner of a Caſtle in <hi>Flanders)</hi> and about 23 Ducatoons in Money with a Paper, the Tenor whereof was thus,</p>

            <p>When the Funeral was paſt, he caſhier'd his new-taken-on ſervants, and razed all the Caſtles he had built in the Air. But above all it troubled him moſt, that he ſhould be ſo forward as to promiſe his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors ſuch ſpeedy Payment, and that with ſuch freedom; he was ſenſible that it would be badly taken out if they found themſelves ſo mocked, and ſo con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

proved no better than a meer Bubble, and to ſtay there much longer was the neareſt way to Priſon.</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this deſign he tranſports all his Effects into the hands of one <hi>Van Galen,</hi> a perſon whom he knew to be really true and honeſt, and therefore repoſed in him the more confidence.

            <p>After he was gone the Creditors came in expectation of receiving full payment, but could neither meet with Man nor Money, ſave only <hi>Odiard,</hi> to whom he had given Procuration, who gave them but litle hopes of getting their Money upon any likely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, eſpecially when beſides many other apologies on behalf <hi>Diomedes,</hi> he told them outright that the name of his inheriting a good Eſtate upon the Deceaſe of his Mother in Law, was but a meer ſham of the Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, declaring the whole ſtory at large. When they heard of that, ſome of them were ſo impatient that they threatned ſpeedy execution: but <hi>Odiard</hi> let them know, that they would get nothing by foul means, and with one ſhow'd them that he had no Effects, and therefore willed them to agree and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with him whilſt it was proffered them.</p>

Some of the Creditors were content to make a compoſition, but others were as unwilling: however at laſt they became of one mind, and deſired the Party impowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to nominate a Place, which he did, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them a Tavern, thinking that ſo when they had got a glaſs of wine, they would be more flexible and eaſier to treat withall, than otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>When they were all come together being 83 perſons in all <hi>Odiard</hi> out of the name of <hi>Diomedes</hi> bad them 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> At which moſt of them flew out in a Paſſion and ſwore they would rather ſpend that money to be revenged on him than to receive it for full Payment; ſo that <hi>Odiard</hi> had a hard taſk to pacify them, and make them have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to liſten to what he would propoſe more. At laſt he came to 8, and 10 <hi>per cent</hi> with which the greater part being pretty warm with wine were content, but the reſt not, thinking to preſs yet more out of him, which they ſeeing that they could not do, aſſented with the reſt, and ſo came to an agreement, <hi>Van Galen</hi> being ſecurity for the money, upon which they parted, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> was ſent for home, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained immediatly to ſell his Houſe, his Summer-Dwelling, Shop and Moveables, and all litle enough to make eaven with his Creditors at Ten in the Hundred.

            <p>Having 8 coſtly Diamond Rings which belonged to his wife <hi>Olympia,</hi> he procures 8 more, every way like thoſe both in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs weight and faſhion, only theſe he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be made, were of Braſs, and falſe ſtones, theſe he put in two ſeveral Boxes, the true and falſe each in a Box apart. He alſo put himſelf into an unwonted habit, colouring his Eie-brows and beard artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and put on a long black Perrywig.</p>
            <p>Thus attired like a <hi>Iew</hi> he directs his Courſe for <hi>Utrecht,</hi> taking the ſaid Boxes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>ng with him. When he was arrived he went forthwith to a Jeweller, where he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41556:112"/>
proffered the Rings to ſale. The Jeweller having thoroughly viewed them he prays <hi>Diomedes</hi> to ſet a Price which he thinking too high bad him ſet a Lower and ſo on till, they made a bargain which was for 4600 <hi>gild.</hi> When they were come to an agreement the Jeweller payd him the Money which he told himſelf before, and prays <hi>Diomedes</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o tell the heaps after him, which he did, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the mean while ſome pieces fall that the Jeweller out of Courteſy took up, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> having the Box of falſe Rings in his handkerchief clandeſtinly by vertue of Hocus Pocus took up the true and lay the falſe in the place, which the Jeweller could not ſo much as once mark.</p>
            <p>Having received the Money, he returns immediately for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> taking a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon by the way, for fear the Jeweller ſhould open the box before he lock'd it up; where arriving he immediatly put on his uſual habit, thinking to ſell thoſe Jewels at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> altho he came to miſcarry in his deſign, for intending to go to a Jewellers houſe he met with one <hi>Muller,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> and a famous Rook at Tables, who in his time had play'd many a Game with <hi>Diomedes.</hi> Theſe two meeting together upon the <hi>Dam-rak</hi> faluted each other, and began to enter into Dialogues about the old concern, that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they both reſolved to have a touch at
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41556:113"/>
Back-gammon together and going into a noted Tavern in the <hi>Calver-ſtreet,</hi> to't they fell, where for 5 or 6 Games at a Ducat each, <hi>Diomedes</hi> won, but <hi>Muller</hi> ſeeing <hi>Diomedes</hi> very eager would not play for leſs that 25 <hi>gild.</hi> which the other, by the encouragement he had already, did not once decline, which at laſt brought our <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſo low that he was fain to depoſe his Jewels, that he in a trice loſt, and was fain to leave his Coat for the Shot; which the next morning he redeemed.</p>
            <p>Our Gentleman now quite deſtitute of money ſtudies what practiſe he ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to get more, and attempting many ways that miſcarried, he at laſt meets with one that was effectual, which was thus.</p>
            <p>Walking along the ſtreets he ſaw a billet newly paſted up upon a Corner-houſe, which many Gentlemen were a reading, it being for the Public Sale of a Garden about half an hours walking without <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and belonged to one Mr. <hi>de Bo—</hi>an eminent Merchant, the ſummer before dwelling at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but then removed to <hi>Haarlem,</hi> partly for that he dreaded a War and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all the perils that Trading perſons are in jeopardy of in ſuch caſes (he being ſufficiently able to live on his yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues) and partly by reaſon that his Lady was for 3 years or more very ſubject to diſeaſes,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41556:113"/>
and adviſed to leave the Town, and receive the benefits of a more ſalubrious Air. This <hi>Diomedes</hi> ſeeing, he applies himſelf to the Gentleman diſguiſed with a black <hi>Perrywig,</hi> Artificial Muſt a chios and Eie brows; beſides a Cloak with the cape richly embroydered, pretending to be a <hi>French</hi> Baron, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to treat with him about his Garden. After many words uſed on both ſides it was reſolved that they ſhould go and view it, which they did. But <hi>Diomedes</hi> told the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he was not willing to venture upon the purchaſe of it, till his Wife arrived who he ſaid was upon the way, and he hoped would be in Town within 2 days, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him not to ſell it till he had given him firſt notice of it (directing the Gentleman to the houſe of one of his Accomplices, where he ſhould enquire of him by the name of Monſr. <hi>de Rocheville)</hi> the Gentleman was content to do ſo, and after a few comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments took their leaves of each other for that time, the Gentleman going to the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>Dool</hi> and <hi>Diomedes</hi> through the Town to ſee if he could meet with a Cully.</p>
            <p>The next morning about 8 a Clock he ſees a Gentleman with his Lady reading the Billet, and cloſing himſelf up with them, could hear by their diſcourſe that the Place and Conditions liked them very well. They aſked a boy where ſuch a ſtreet was (being
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41556:114"/>
the place where the Owner lived, as it was ſpecified in the Bill) <hi>Diomedes</hi> (anticipating the boys anſwer) aſks them if they had a mind to ſee the Garden; <hi>Yes, very gladly,</hi> replies the Gentlewoman, <hi>if we could find the owners houſe. Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diomedes, I ſhall ſhow you my Garden: The Key is at my Brothers houſe, here hard by.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Lady follow <hi>Diomedes</hi> to the owners houſe, where coming he enters in before them, and aſks the Maid for her Maſter, who made anſwer that he was not a ſtirring, <hi>Pre'thee Sweetheart</hi> (quoth he) <hi>deſire your Maſter to lend me the Key of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and tell him I ſhall return it towards night, and come and diſcourſe him about the Bargain, ſo ſoon as my wife has ſeen it.</hi> This he ſaid whiſpering, ſo that the Gentleman and his Conſort could not hear. The Maid goes up to her Maſter and tells him that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was there the other day was come with his Lady to ſee the Garden, and deſired to have the Key. Mr. <hi>de Bo—</hi>bids her give it him, and with one beg his excuſe that he could not wait upon them thither, he being at that time not very well diſpoſed, and deſired a litle reſt.</p>
            <p>With that <hi>Diomedes</hi> goes out, taking the Gentleman and his Lady with him, and brought them to the Garden, which they having thoroughly viewed, and examined
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41556:114"/>
all the Con-and In-conveniences about the Premiſſes, fell to bargaining.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> conſidering that it was not ſafe for him to fell it as the uſual manner was, to be paid in 2 or 3 Terms, but rather to ſee if he could make it to be paid in ready money, and accordingly makes his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That if they would pay in ready money he would allow them 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> If in 3 moneths, 2 and a half <hi>per cent</hi> &amp;c. The Gentleman calls his wife aſide, and debates the matter with her, who counſelled him rather to pay the Money down immediately, ſince that was a conſiderable profit. In ſum they agreed for 3440 <hi>gild.</hi> for the Garden Orchard, Houſe, Ponds and all other Appurtenances, and the next day Writings were drawn, and the Money tendered: with which <hi>Diomedes</hi> trudges away, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing he would go and fetch them the Key, which according to his word he had carryed home before promiſing to wait upon the Owner the next day in the Afternoon. Long waited the Buyer for his Chapman with the Key, who came not: ever now and then he peeped out to ſee if he could ſee him, but all in vain for no Chapman comes. About 2 in the afternoon when they had dined, the Gentlewoman councils her huſband to take a walk &amp; ſee if they could find the houſe, which by the help of the printed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41556:115"/>

               </gap> if they had not the Key of the Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Owner over-hearing, ſteps out to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> down ſtairs, and away they went together. By the way the Owner aſks the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman if her huſband did not go with them, <hi>Yes Sir,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>this is my huſband. Nay,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but I mean the Gentleman that was with you yeſterday, with the Cloak embroyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Cape and a black Perrywig. Why,</hi> replies the Lady, <hi>I know not that you have ſeen me in company with any ſuch Gentleman ſince I came to Town, unleſs it be your Brother, of whom we bought the Garden. My Brother!</hi> replies the Owner <hi>I have neither Brother nor Siſter in the whole World, as for the Garden it belongs ſolely to me.</hi> Upon theſe words the Gentleman and his Wife were ſo ſurpriſed that they had not the power to move one ſtep forward, but ſtanding ſtill they looked one another in the face as pale as Death. ſuſpecting indeed that there might be ſome Roguery in the caſe, the rather when they bethought themſelves that <hi>Diomedes</hi> did not appear, ſince he had received the Money. At laſt the Gentlewoman who could not any longer contein her ſelf burſt forth into theſe

Hereupon they began to ſtare one another in the Face, and ſo aſtoniſhed that they knew not whether they dreamed or were awake. In ſum after a long diſpute and in the heat of Fury they fell to loud, but not angry words, and obſerving the People to begin to cluſter they returned to the Gentlemans Lodgings, where they heard one another at large and brought the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Notary that ſigned the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, altho it did not ſignify much ſince it was conſpicuouſly evident that the Garden belonged to Mr. <hi>de Bo—</hi>and that none elſe had any Title to it, as alſo that he had no ſuch Brother in the World. Their extreme ſhift was to ſend all over the Town to inquire for the Party, that had ſold the Premiſſes, but none ſuch could be found
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41556:116"/>
or heard of, for he had quite altered his, habit, and put on a flaxen wig; and the Gentleman fain to be content with the Cheat he had put upon him, and comfort himſelf with the wit he had bought at ſo dear a rate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> having got ſuch a noble purchaſe he reſolves to ſet up ſhop again, and try what he could do that way once more; and in order thereto buys a good quantity of Silks, paying ſome part in ready moneys, and the reſt he took upon Truſt, amongſt which Goods he alſo ſtow'd thoſe which he had Stole (mentioned <hi>pag</hi> 190) he hired alſo a maid to keep the ſhop, to diſpatch errands, and the like.</p>
            <p>It happened that 2 famous Pick-pockets came out of <hi>North-Holland</hi> to practiſe in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> both Women, Theſe two being above the degree of your ordinary Filchers, made up a project between them which was thus. They went to a Chirurgeon of known fame for his great ability and skil, whom they accoſted after this manner, <hi>Sir, we have been happily informed of your great experience in the Myſteries of Chirurgery, after which we have been in ſome meſure reſtleſs, till we have been ſo fortunate as to ſpeak with you about a Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ours, which is at certain times of the Moon troubled with a Lunacy, and by reaſon it was adviſed by ſome of great Judgements to let her blood, we therefore come to give you the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

your helpful hand and advice in the matter, her head is ſometimes ſo perplexed with worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſhe being indeed by nature, much addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to avarice; and when ſhe ſuffers under thoſe ſad paſſions talks of nothing elſe than Money and Goods.</hi> The Chirurgeon told them he was well aſſured that he could do it if it were practicable by human skill and told them that if they pleaſed to bring her, he would give them his advice. The one of them makes anſwer, that all the cunning muſt be in bringing her thither, and when brought for them to get out of her ſight, for ſo long as they were preſent ſhe was ten times worſe than otherwiſe: To which the Surgeon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies he had a very convenient back-door by which if they thought good they might ſlip out, having firſt led her into the Parlour. This advice was very acceptable, and they accordingly went out to market, where the firſt ſhop they found moſt likely for their turn was that of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> where they bought to the value of 460 <hi>gild.</hi> in flower'd Silks which done they pray'd <hi>Diomedes</hi> to ſend his Maid along with them to receive the Money to which he aſſented, ſo away they go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till coming at the Chirurgeons, they went directly into the Parlor, the Maid following, one of the Women carrying the Silks: but when the Maid would have gone quite thro, the Chirurgeon puſh'd to the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41556:117"/>
Door and would not let her go any further; the Women in the mean time running out at the Back-door, and the Surgeon with the help of his Man took the Maid and made her faſt to the ſtool with a Towel, making alſo her hands and feet faſt, upon which ſhe roars out, crying, <hi>What d'ee mean, Sir? pray what do you intend to do?</hi> The Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon takes no notice of her words, but goes on with his work, takes her Arm and binds it faſt with a clout, ſhe all the time crying out, <hi>I come not here to be let blood, I come for my Money, and Money I will have before I go out, What do you intend to murther me? You rogue! You villain let me go, and give me my money, or elſe my goods again.</hi> Still the Surgeon proceeds on with his work, taking his launce lets her blood in ſpite of all ſhe could ſay or do, till at laſt he perceived her ſwound away, and then ſtopt the Vein, binds it carefully up, and takes ſpirit of Harts-horn and other foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid Quinteſſences which he held under her noſe, ſprinkling a litle Vinegar upon her face, till ſhe recovered. So ſoon as ſhe came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to her ſelf again, ſhe began with fair means to enquire after the Women that had brought her thither, as alſo what was become of the Silks. The Surgeon hearing her name the Goods ſo ſpecially, began then to miſtruſt ſomthing of reality might be in the caſe, and after hearing the thing more amply, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41556:117"/>
finding that ſhe had her perfect underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, began to repent his raſhneſs, begging a hundred times pardon of the Maid. and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her how that he was deceived, &amp;c. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he untied the Bands and ſet her at liberty. The Maid goes out ſadly diſmayed and ran all about to enquire after the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but to no purpoſe, ſo that ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain to return home without either money or Goods. Her maſter ſeeing her ſo pale, which was occaſioned partly by the loſs of her blood, and partly at the loſs of the Goods, he asked her, what ſhe ail'd; and what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen her? She made anſwer, that ſhe was cheated by the two Women, and told him all the whole paſſage that had happened to her ſince ſhe went out. He underſtanding the matter at large for a while raged and ſtormed at the Women who had play'd him that dirty trick.</p>
            <p>After he had kept Shop about a moneth or two, and ſpent the Stock as well as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſo that the ſhelves began to grow thin, he went about to ſee if he could meet with a Whole-ſale Cully of whom he might receive Goods upon Credit; but to his ſorrow could not meet with one but what would have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon Delivery.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it happened that the two Gentlemen who had been ſecurity for him at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> for his Countrey houſe, came to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41556:118"/>
urge the laſt Payment, which was only 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After he had been there ſeveral times with <hi>Diomedes,</hi> he told him that a certain Merchant in <hi>Rotterdam</hi> had deſired of him to enquire if he could hear of a good Cuſtomer for him, who could help him off with ſome ſilks, who if he be an honeſt man, he deſired no mony before he ſhut his books; and with all told <hi>Diomede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now it happened upon a time that 3 Men were carried by to Priſon, which the Maid running out haſtily to look after forgot the Key of her Trunk upon the Compter, which he ſeeing, went to meet her at the door, and ſent her of an errand, which ſhe, not once thinking of her Keys, went to do: in the mean time <hi>Diomedes</hi> goes up ſtairs and unlocks her Trunk where he found Seven Hundred Rix-dollars, upon which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in two Neighbours, and in their preſence
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41556:124"/>
took them out with ſome pieces of Silk which he alſo found there, locks the Trunk and lays the Key in the ſame poſture and place he found it in.</p>
            <p>About 2 or 3 days after the Maid having occaſion to go abroad reſolved to take ſome Money with her, to buy one knick-knack or other, and finding the neſt but the birds flown, comes running down ſtairs, crying out, ſhe was rob'd, and her Trunk had been broke open. Upon which <hi>Diomedes</hi> made anſwer that ſhe was not rob'd, but his Shop and Money-box, with one telling her what he had done, and in what manner, to wit, in preſence of 2 Neighbours, and threatned her beſides that if ſhe would not make a candid confeſſion of all, he would deliver her over into the Hands of Juſtice. The Maid ſwore and curſed her ſelf with many imprecations that ſhe was wrong'd, and that the money was honeſtly come by: in ſhort they fell out ſo deſperately, and words on both ſides grew ſo loud that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to throng about the Door, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> thought it his beſt courſe to give over, leſt ſhe ſhould bolt out ſome of his Roguery, which ſhe was well acquainted with. For in the middle of their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy ſhe gave him now and then a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow or hint of Rope-merits. So that for that time they left off, but falling into a more
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41556:124"/>
ſerious diſcourſe at night ſhe entred into a new Covenant with him, that for the future he ſhould not tax her with ſuch enormous Crimes as ſhe proteſted ſhe was never facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of, and with one told him how that every one knew that the Mercer was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he knew him for the Party that was guilty of the Fact, &amp;c. Theſe and other reaſons compelled <hi>Diomedes</hi> to take all in good part, and put up the matter. Whence we may obſerve that the wicked practiſes of ſome men prove a bridle to hold them in, and arm them with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſo that they are fain to ſmother ſuch abuſes as inwardly torment them, and are oftentimes forced to comply with that which they have all their Life time to repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fernelia</hi> (for that was the Maids name) was none of the meaneſt Beauties, but very ill bred, and with all inclinable to ſtrife, whoſe litigious ſpirit none ever could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, till ſhe came into his ſervice, which for the aforeſaid reaſons, ſore againſt his will he was fain to bear. Many times he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to violate her chaſtity, but could never obtain his will, for which he took a ſpecial liking to her, and at long laſt fell a courting her in a ſeeming way, but becauſe ſhe was of very mean Parentage he had no great ſtomach to adventure himſelf with her. However ſhe held her ſelf very coy. He
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41556:125"/>
therefore to ſhow her more kindneſs and the reſpect he had for her gave her a larger liberty, and hired another Maid to be under her, and by the means of <hi>Zenodor</hi> furniſhed himſelf ſo with Goods that he left of the Retail-trade, and fell to Whole-ſale, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Windows and Doors. <hi>Fernelia</hi> ſeeing the great reſpect he had for her, and that the other Maid as well as the Man began to ſtand in aw of her, ſhe began privately to act her part to inveigle him ſo much as was poſſible at an under: and to that end went oftentimes to a Popiſh Chappel, under a great ſhow of Devotion and Piety, knowing him to be that way inclinable, being the Religion he was educated in. Every night at going to Bed ſhe would mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over a buſhel of <hi>Ave Maria's,</hi> interluding alwayes a <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and that ſo as he could very well hear her.

Her attire ſhe made after the neweſt mode, and her head ſhe trickt up with Points and Laces, leaving her Breaſts not plainly open, but juſt ſo as his eie might have the benefit of an acceptable Object, thereby to allure and make him more eager in the purſuit of his ſcope. Every morning as ſoon as ſhe roſe up, ſhe went and paid her duty to the Looking glaſs, and ſet her Locks in order, as the Mercer does his Silks in the ſhop-windows, waſhing her Virgins face with perfumed Waters, then ſetting of all her accoutrements, which during commonly a third part of the day, <hi>Diomedes</hi> blindly ſuppoſed it to be ſpent in Devotion.

            <p>This Letter with another ſhe cunningly laid in a French Dictionary, which ſhe had ſome time before borrowed of her Maſter,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41556:128"/>
the Letter being written in that Language which ſhe ſpoke expertly well, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally upon her going out a Doors upon a certain Meſſage, ſhe aſked <hi>Diomedes</hi> about ſome words in French, that ſhe was ſure he did not know, but muſt have recourſe to that very place in the Dictionary to reſolve her in, and ſeeing him ſtep into the Parlour, (as ſhe was ſure) to fetch the Dictionary, ſhe ſtept out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> turns over the leaves, and finds the Letter, for there the Book opened of it ſelf, and at the firſt glance ſaw the words DEAR MADAM, was ſo ſurpriſed, that taking out the Letters, he cloſed to the Book, and quite forgot the words ſhe aſked him about: when he perceived that ſhe was gone he read the Letter, which ſtruck him into a deep Melancholy, wherein he continued till ſhe came home, expecting his laſt doom with the turning of her eie, ſhe when returned knew the occaſion of his ſadneſs and finding the ſtratagem take well, tormented him ſo much the more, by coy anſwers, and averſe looks. Long laſted this misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between them, and yet he never met with a poſitiv denial, for ſo doing ſhe feared he might quite renounce her and implant his affections on another, ſo as that all her ſubtility could not revoke them. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ever went ſhe to Church but he out of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41556:129"/>
Jealouſy would follow her and take his place at a convenient diſtance, where he might ſee her. One time it happened that in Lent ſhe went to <hi>Veſpers,</hi> being pretty late in the Evening when the Church went out, and coming out of Doors he eſpied a young Gentlewoman both of Habit, Body, Geſture and all things elſe like her, whom he follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and indeavoured to cloſe up with her. It happened that <hi>Fernelia</hi> came out juſt after him and ſeeing him go <hi>jig</hi> by <hi>joll</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuſpected it was ſome new Darling or other, which becauſe of her own obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy he courted, thought it high time to accept of his proffer, and to dally no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with him, and according to that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ariſing from a caſual paſſage gave her aſſent to what he propoſed and within a few days after ratified the matter.</p>
            <p>Our Bridegroom invites all his Creditors to a ſplendid Feaſt ſetting <hi>Zenodor</hi> in the higheſt place at Table, thinking now for the laſt time to treat them at their own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they being upwards of 170 perſons (as the Party imployed to invite them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) none knowing that he was Debtor to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> had for this end prepared a great Table which was made on purpoſe, for the entertainment of ſo many Gueſts, placing (as was ſaid) <hi>Zenodor</hi> at the upper end and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41556:129"/>
his principal Creditor at his Right hand, and next to him one to whom he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted a litle leſs, and ſo gradually all his Creditors according to the greatneſs of their claims. The table was ſet with all ſorts of delicacies that was acceptable for the pallat. After the meal was over they fell to play and paſtim, as is there uſual upon ſuch occaſions, which continued till about 12 a clock at night: when the Bridegroom took his Bride and conducted her to Bed, which was very gorgeouſly ſet out.</p>
            <p>But before he enjoyed the delights of a nuptial bed fell out a diſmal chance; for <hi>Cecil</hi> the other Maid envying the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Fernelia</hi> ſtudied how ſhe might deprive her of the Careſſes ſhe truſted to receive from her haſty Bridegoom: and well knowing that the Bride was ever more fearfull of Ratts, ſhe went to a Maulſters houſe that was not very far from thence, and pray'd the Servant that when he took a live Rat in the Trap that he ſhould keep them for her; and the night before this jovial day he chanced to take a couple which he delivered to <hi>Cecil.</hi> The Rats ſhe took and having bruſed the feet of the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Stones, ſhe put them both under an Earthen Pot in the Bed and covered over with the Bed-cloaths that it could not be diſcerned, and the Ear of the Pot ſo faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41556:130"/>
with the ſheet that by turning up the Cloaths the Pot muſt alſo turn up. The Bridegroom and his Bride being both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt he turns up the Coverlet and ſheet, upon which one of the Ratts ran out and the other lay wallowing upon the Bed. The Bride ſeeing this, ſhreeked out, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſwounded away, and fell upon the Floor, as inſenſible as the feigned Nio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that was transformed into a ſtone. No leſs amazed was he to ſee his Jewel in ſuch a Condition, he not knowing in the World what to do, for indeavouring to raiſe her up and if poſſible to draw on her Morning Gown, found her as heavy as leed, and cold, her Countenance was as pale as a dead Corps. Long ſtrugled he to get her up but all to little purpoſe inſomuch that he was fain to cry out.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Three days after this <hi>Fernelia</hi> lay ſick, and bedded not with her Bridegroom till the fourth night.</p>
            <p>When all thoſe things were paſt, and the jovial days ended, <hi>Diomedes</hi> began to make ſpeculation upon his Darling, who for the firſt 2 Moneths gave him all imaginable contentment, inſomuch that all what ever ſhe deſired or demanded was granted: ſo that nothing was ſeen between them but the real Tokens of Love, and with great aſſuredneſs he imparted all to her that he had in his Heart, little diſtruſting that it would prove ſo great a trouble to him in after times; for this morning had a foul evening, and this Beggar he had ſet a Horſe-back was quickly upon the Gallop.</p>
            <p>When the ſubtle <hi>Fernelia</hi> was made privy to his Heart, and was ſenſible of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, began to act for Empreſs; and bridled him ſo in, that he had not the leſt word to ſay for himſelf, but, like a Bear with a ring in his ſnout, muſt go where his Owner leads him, to clear himſelf it was in vain, for ſo he might prove himſelf a Lyar,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41556:132"/>
and to Hector it out was unſafe, for he knew the perils he was under if ſhe out of a raſh and inſubid humour ſhould, publiſh his Knavery abroad; thus he ſtill continued in torments and ſubject to the greateſt and worſt of Plagues, which is a <hi>Womans Tongue.</hi> Her <hi>Pater-Noſters</hi> were now Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into Oaths and curſes, her <hi>Ave Maria's</hi> into Nicknames and Rehearſals of his Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, her Hypocritical Prayers were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a perpetual ſcolding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightful language, all which he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take in good part. <hi>Emilia</hi> 'tis true could uſe her clapper with great Dexterity, but he had the ſame advantages againſt <hi>her,</hi> which this had againſt <hi>him; Olimpia's</hi> Tongue was alſo well hung but ſhe ever had reaſon on her ſide, which he with reaſon could never either blame or oppoſe, and by both theſe came his Fortune: but from this it was far more intolerable being by him advanced from the Dunghil, to the ſpire of Fortune: her tongue was void of all reaſon and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nay the very Quinteſſence of all the Shrews tongues in <hi>Europe.</hi> For knowing well that altho before ſhe was the Maid, and he Lord and Maſter, yet by her hypocriſy and ſhow of Probity ſhe was mounted as high as he; where he way <hi>Cajus</hi> ſhe was <hi>Caja,</hi> was he <hi>Leo?</hi> ſhe was <hi>Leaena:</hi> nay altho ſhe would allow him to be the <hi>Head,</hi> ſhe would be ſure

to be the <hi>Cap:</hi> In ſhort their Harmony was ſuch that he could not endure an Equal, nor ſhe a Superior.</p>
            <p>The ſhop was ſolely managed after her pleaſure, and ſervants taken in, and caſhier'd as it beſt liked her. She hired many young men to keep her ſhop but either finding, them by aſſed on her Husbands ſide or too dull, ever turned them away, till at laſt ſhe met with two for her turn, both of a ſtamp: theſe ſhe frequently admitted where it was illicit for any ſave her husband. Never went he abroad but they were a junketting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſeldom ſtay'd he at Home, for Home was his Hell: this gave them occaſion frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly to carouſe together, with a crew of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Whores and Rogues, and all at the Coſt of the Good man of the houſe, whoſe ill-got wealth, was ſpent upon a way as diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and light.</p>
            <p>Such were now the animoſities between them that they ſeldom lay together, a thing purpoſely created by her ſelf, the better to entertain her Paramours, who took their Turns; Nor did ſhe ſpare the ſhop to ſerve them in what they deſired or demanded.

When ſupper was ended, they fell to Singing, Dancing and Playing upon different Inſtruments; others fell to Gaming and play; and others recreated themſelves with other Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In ſum they ſpent the fore part of the night in variety of Paſtime; till the moſt part grew a litle light-headed, upon which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve them, but that each ſhould go to bed with his Darling, others there were ſo ſenſual and ſhameleſs among them, that they ran up and down the houſe naked to the ſhift: and threw their Cloaths all on a heap together.

Now was he in a thouſand doubts what to do, not daring to go in for fear they ſeeing no other ſhift to eſcape might fall upon his bones, or otherwiſe that his Wife, who when inraged would out run the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of reaſon, and ſo teach him to climb the Ladder, for with one word ſpeaking he was a man of Death. But ſeeing all the Candles put out he went foftly into the Room where their Cloaths lay on a heap, and took away their Breeches, Shoes and Perry wigs which he lock'd up in a Room apart and went out, walking the ſtreets till he ſaw light in a Tavern whither he went and calling for a Manchet and a Pint of Sack, he looked over all the Papers that he had found in their Pockets, having alſo plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them of their Watches, Gold and what elſe he could come by. Amongſt thoſe Papers he found divers Bills of Exchange and Letters of Importance which gave him light enough to know that ſeveral Merchants Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were in the Rout: and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himſelf who they were and where
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41556:134"/>
their Maſters lived, as alſo others among them who were married men, he diſpatched Letters to ſuch Merchants as he underſtood thoſe Youngmen ſerved, including the Bills and Letters which he found in their Pockets, theſe he ſent away with a Porter, who he thought did not know him. He ſent alſo letters to thoſe honeſt Gentlemens Wives, who had their Rendezvous at his houſe, and told them where they ſhould find their huſbands.</p>
            <p>The next morning when they all awaked ſome ſo beſotted with Liquor that they hardly wiſt where they were, but had quite forgot the mad Frolicks they had acted the night before, others who had ſitten up late at play could hardly be awakened by their Companions: in ſum it was high light day before any of them ſtirred; but hearing ſome people at the Door, who had knocked 3 or 4 times before they within knew. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi> hearing that ſome body knockt at Door and ſaw it light day, was in a lamentable conſternation, not knowing what to do: fearing firſt that it was her huſband who might be returned ſooner than was expected; and ſecondly how to get the Company out without being taken notice of. Still they continued knocking at the Door, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred as if they would knock the houſe down: <hi>Fernelia,</hi> calls her man <hi>Tom,</hi> who
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41556:134"/>
lay behind her, for he was her chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp; the only perſon for whoſe ſake the had made this ſplendid Treat: <hi>Tom</hi> begins to rub his eies, and gruntles, loath to riſe, ſtill ſhe thumps him and told him there was ſome body at Door, by degrees, tho with much ado ſhe gets <hi>Tom</hi> to creep out of his neſt, they all the while knocking at Door. But now comes the miſchief! <hi>Tom</hi> hears'em knock and would ſlip on his cloaths to let'em in, but could find no Breeches; long hunted he up and down the Room, but all labour in vain, no Breeches were to be found. <hi>Fernelia</hi> ſeeing him ſo ſlow to go to the Door bawls out, <hi>You Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what d'ee intend to do? will you open the Door, or not? Tom</hi> replies he could not find his Breeches, and without his Breeches he would not go: while <hi>Tom</hi> and his Miſtreſs ſtood jarring together the reſt awakened, and ſeeing it was day began to look for their cloaths, but none could make a complete ſuit, ſome wanted a ſtocking, another wanted a ſhoe, a third wants his Perrywig and Coat, in ſhort they were all in a great trouble, not knowing in the World what to do; the People at Door ſtill continuing knocking ſo that abundance were gathered together before the houſe, one not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing anothers buſineſs. At laſt <hi>Fernelia</hi> prevailed with her Paramour <hi>Tom</hi> to go down
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41556:135"/>
breechleſs, and return one anſwer or other. Who ſo ſoon as he enquired who there was, heard a diverſity of voices and that of Women as well as Men, was at a ſtand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould open the Door or no; for not withſtanding his excuſes, as that his Miſtreſs was not a ſtirring and the like, they ſtill inſiſted to come in. They above hearing who were at Door, by their Voices which they knew, ſtrictly forbid <hi>Tom</hi> to open the Door, and held a Conſultation among themſelves what was beſt to be done in this caſe. Some were for running out at the Back-door, but it being high light day, and people all abroad it was not held for good, for that the Men wanted their Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; the Women either their Gowns or Petticoats. At length it was concluded by mature deliberation that <hi>Fernelia</hi> ſhould go to the Window and demand what they would have. But looking out ſhe eſpied the <hi>Schout</hi> coming with half a dozen Women, who were the Wives of thoſe Men that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; upon which ſhe ran up and gave them warning, and pray'd them as they tendered their wellfar, to run out at the Back-door, with ſuch cloaths as they had; upon which ſome ran out as they were, others ſupplied themſelves with <hi>Diomedes</hi> his cloaths, in ſhort they ran all out like ſo many mice at the appearance of a Cat, leaving <hi>Fernelia</hi> alone
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41556:135"/>
with her two Men and Maids. By that time they were all got out came the Officer to the Door, who upon his knocking was let in with an infinite train of People, as well thoſe that were concerned, as others, who in ſpite of all they could do ruſhed in. The <hi>Schout</hi> ſeeing the Back-door open, ran out that way, where he was informed by the Neighbourhood what way his Game lay, which he purſued, taking only a Merchants Book-keeper 2 Vintners and a Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Wife, who, to make their eſcape went aboard a ſmall veſſel, but the Maſter not daring to conceal them when he ſaw, the <hi>Schout</hi> come to demand'em, ſurrenders them all into his hand; upon which they were carried half naked thro the ſtreets to the great amazement of all the Town, and ſo committed to ſafe Cuſtody, where after 16 days they had a Hearing where the <hi>Schout</hi> made a heavy demaund, either a corporal Penalty and Baniſhment, or an Equivalent ſum of Money, and ſuch as neither of the Vintners was able to pay without Ruin of their Families: ſo that their Wives who were the Parties aggrieved wrought all they could that they might be baniſhed; which ſentence was paſſed upon them. The Book-keeper was for this and other Crimes, which he was found guilty of, condemned to be publicly whipt upon the Scaffold, and ſet in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41556:136"/>
the <hi>Raſp-</hi>houſe for 13 years; and as for the Shoemakers Wife ſhe ſaved them that labour having that Morning her Sentence was read ſtrangled her ſelf in the Dungeon with her Garters.</p>
            <p>The reſt who eſcaped the hands of Juſtice for that time, either fled, or reconciled themſelves at Home, the Servants to their Maſters, and the Men to their Wives, who knew well that what the Schout demanded would tend to their own Ruin, whether Money or Baniſhment, for which reaſon they rather chuſed to brook ſuch enormities, than ſeek revenge which would coſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo dear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> either out of Fear or Shame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf ſo long, till <hi>Fernelia</hi> had made ſale of all they had in the Houſe and Shop, which ſhe converted into Gold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to run away with her Paramour (as not long after ſhe did) But <hi>Diomedes</hi> coming home prevented her Journey for that time. So ſoon as he entred in he ſaw all the Goods taken down and the ſhelves empty, as alſo all the Furniture that was in the whole houſe, at firſt concluded, that he had made a Cudgel for his own pate, and that the <hi>Schout</hi> had made a ſeizin of all they had for this Delinquency, for as yet he had no certain information how things went, and ſhe for her part palliated the buſineſs ſo long
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41556:136"/>
as ſhe could. All the Arguments he uſed were but loſt labour; for ſhe ſcolded as hard as ever, and threatned to publiſh his Roguery to the World, which he knew was the High way to be hang'd. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolves with himſelf not to make any ſtirr till he had got as much as he could by <hi>Zenodor,</hi> his Implement of Credit, and afterwards revenge himſelf of her and leave the Town.</p>
            <p>With this Reſolution he went to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant with whom he made a bargain for ſome Kerſeys and Leed, amounting to 4300 <hi>gild.</hi> but treating upon the Conditions of Payment, <hi>Diomedes</hi> would have him to deliver the Goods upon Credit, which the Merchant would in no wiſe yield to; <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> therefore offers him the ſecurity of <hi>Zenodor:</hi> the Merchant replies that he knew him not, but within a day or 2 he would give him an Anſwer upon the Exchange. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> for that time goes his way, and the Merchant ſubtilly went to enquire after <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodor,</hi> ſending firſt one to offer him a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for a ſmall ſum pretending that he was a little neceſſitated for Money at that time, which was the only reaſon of his ſo doing, and that he ſhould not ſuppoſe that it was a defective or endamaged Commodity but worth a 3d more if ſold upon Credit. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodor</hi> makes his excuſe and ſaid he was out
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41556:137"/>
of Caſh. Beſides this he ſent another Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or Explorator, who aſked him if he would ſell him either <hi>Rent briefs,</hi> Lands, or Houſes, ſaying that he was to take a Journey for <hi>Italy</hi> where he was to ſtay ſome years, and was willing therefore to ſee his Money well beſtow'd before he took his Journey thither, adding thereby, that he would not ſtick out for a ſmall matter if he ſaw any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that liked him well. This <hi>Zenodor</hi> alſo waved, ſaying he had none of all theſe to convey at that time. When the Merchant underſtood this, he gathered that <hi>Zenodor</hi> having neither Money to lay out upon an advantagious bargain, profeſſing Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; nor yet any Eſtate to alienate, that he was no ſufficient Perſon. <hi>Diomedes,</hi> not daring to appear upon the Exchange, went the day appointed very early to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants houſe, and deſires to know if he was ſatisfied with his Man. The Merchant would not make him any direct reply as to the perſon, but deſired him to excuſe him, for that he was not minded to part with his Goods but for ready Money, with which Anſwer <hi>Diomedes</hi> was fain to march, ſadly troubled that his Machine fail'd him, in a time ſo conſtringent and urging.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw that the angry Starres, had made this Enterpriſe unlucky, and that his attempt had ſuch a poor Event, as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41556:137"/>
in comparing it with the ſucceſs of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer undertakings he reckoned this. He fell upon another Project which was the laſt and worſt he ever met with, if all circumſtances be conſidered.</p>
            <p>He applies himſelf to a Merchant who had a Bargain of Elephants Teeth, Indico and Rice. Of theſe three Commodities he bought to the value of 7500 <hi>gild.</hi> but, <hi>a Child once burn'd dreads the Fire.</hi> Or as the Latin Adage, <hi>Ictus piſcator ſapit,</hi> So the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant who had but newly had a miſtake in giving Credit ſo lightly, would not part with his Goods without either ready Money or very good ſecurity. <hi>Diomedes</hi> not able to make up ſuch a ſum complete, promiſed him that he would give him the ſecurity of <hi>Zenodor.</hi> But this Merchant as well as the former refuſed to deliver any parcel of the Wares till he had ſpoke with <hi>Zenodor:</hi> but told him becauſe he would not detain him in ſuſpence, that he would go with him after Exchange time and ſee if he liked him, ſeeing <hi>Zenodor</hi> was a Gentleman he had no knowledge of, neither perſonally, nor by fame. Upon this they took their leaves of each other. <hi>Diomedes</hi> immediatly repairs to his Tool <hi>Zenodor</hi> and tells him of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, praying him to humor the matter well, which <hi>Zenodor</hi> promiſed to do; and in order thereto ſends his Caſhier and Foot-man
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41556:138"/>
out with Baggs of Counters and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Plates, inſtructing them how they ſhould demean themſelves, and be ready at ſuch an Hour. <hi>Diomedes</hi> at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed went to dance attendance, and brings his Merchant with him: where co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Zenodor</hi> ſat at Table, but ordered them to ſtep into the Parlour, promiſing to wait upon them immediatly. The Merchant ſeeing that <hi>Zenodor</hi> had a great houſe and rich furniture (at leſt in the Room where he then ſat) ſeemed to be well ſatisfied with the Partie, but the more when he ſaw ſo many bags brought in one after another: but by that time <hi>Zenodor</hi> was come down to know their pleaſure one of the men infortunately let one of the Bags fall, which being very ponderous burſt up the ſeem, and thereupon let all the leaden pieces tumble about the Floor, which the Merchant ſeeing, began to ſmell a Cheat and diſtruſt his Partie. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> and <hi>Zenodor</hi> were ſo ſuddenly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that they could not invent any ſpeedy excuſe to palliate the Roguery. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſeeing them ſo look one upon another and both bluſh, concluded that it was a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem and conſequently without any open offence let them know that if <hi>Diomedes</hi> would have the Goods and pay down ready Money, he would not diſpoſe of them within a certain of Days, or otherwiſe he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41556:138"/>
deſired to be rid of his bargain: ſo that <hi>Diomedes</hi> found there was no hopes of taking the Cully that bout. When the Merchant was gone they began to chide the man who let it fall, altho durſt not much provoke him, well knowing in what poſture affairs ſtood with them.</p>
            <p>Monſr. <hi>de Kleyn</hi> (for that was the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants name) was well ſatisfied with the accident, being delivered (as he had reaſon to beleeve) from the ſnare, yet could not but tell it abroad how narrowly he had ſcap'd a ſcouring; which was preſently noiſed through the Town, &amp; brought ſo long from hand to hand, that the Creditors of <hi>Diomedes</hi> came to have notice of it: Of which <hi>Diomedes</hi> himſelf being ſenſible fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw into what ſtate he was like to fall, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when all had him in the eie for a Cheat.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this the continual ſtorming of <hi>Fernelia,</hi> who was now grown paſt ſhame, and ſo impudent that ſhe began to be a Town-talk was the occaſion of ſome fear on the other hand, for he was ſure that in caſe Juſtice ſhould demand him, <hi>Fernelia</hi> would be the firſt that ſhould betray him, as indeed hearing of this miſchance ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do, having ſent Letters abroad to ſeveral places where ſhe knew he had offended, as alſo to every one of his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41556:139"/>
reſpectively, though with that ſecrecy that none knew from whence, incloſing in each of them a Paſquil in Rhyme which ſhe cauſed alſo to be printed, and cried about ſtreets by the Hawkers, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our decay'd Merchant.</p>
            <p>The ſame night that ſhe had diſperſed thoſe in famous Libels againſt her huſband, ſhe held a conſult with her Paramour to run away and having changed all ſhe had into Gold and Jewels, the next morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe ſet forth, leaving her huſband, houſe and the remainder of the Goods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Zenodor</hi> alſo having a hint of what was noiſed abroad, were ſenſible that an incumbent danger threatned them, they gathered together as much Moneys as they could on a ſudden and ſet forward for <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> the Mercer whoſe Shop <hi>Diomedes</hi> had pillaged, and the injured Parties at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> coming now by theſe Libels to hear who it was that had been the Agreſſor, went privately to the <hi>Schout</hi> with Intention to apprehend him: but coming to his houſe found nothing but a Child of 3 years old crying in bed, and a few pieces of Silk, which it ſeems <hi>Fernelia</hi> thought not vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They therefore diſpatched Letters abroad deſcribing <hi>Zenodor</hi> and <hi>Diomedes,</hi> that they might be apprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:41556:139"/>
The Debtors alſo came and ſeized upon what was left, and by an Order from Court expoſed all to public ſale, of which when they had made a Dividend could not make One <hi>per cent.</hi> The Child was immediatly ſent away to the Hoſpital to be educated, among the Orphans.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Zenodor</hi> were arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Zenodor</hi> no more able to be any way inſtrumental to his Patron, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> demands the Goods which the other had in poſſeſſion. And adviſed him to ſeek for a new Imployment; but <hi>Zenodor</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing approaching poverty and himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of further means to live with that ſplendor which he had of late done, would in no wiſe yield to the delivery of what he had, alledging that he ought to have an equal ſhare in them, ſince his help was the greateſt Inſtrument in the acquiſition of all <hi>Diomedes</hi> of late enjoyed. In brief the diſpute continued ſo long between them, that they drew upon the Place and puſhed ſeveral times at each other. Till <hi>Diomedes</hi> receiving a ſtab under the right Pap fell down to the Earth. <hi>Zenodor</hi> ſeeing him ſo diſabled had notwithſtanding his Fury compaſſion of his Antagoniſt, and inſtead of diſpatching him holp him up upon his Feet, brought him to a Chirurgeon and uſed all poſſible means he could, to bring him to a recovery: beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41556:140"/>
forgiveneſs a hundred times, and pray'd him notwithſtanding this fatal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to continue friendſhip, with many ſolemn promiſes never to forſake him. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> knowing what occaſion he had for his help, did freely pardon him, altho, <hi>mente manſit alta repôſtum.</hi> he in wardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the old Grudge, and fully reſolved to revenge himſelf upon him.</p>
            <p>When our Patient was reſtored to his former health, he prayed <hi>Zenodor</hi> to take a Journey with him to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> where he would fetch 8000 <hi>gild.</hi> in Gold that he had hid in the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zenodor</hi> not in the leſt diſtruſting any thing ſhow'd himſelf very free and willing to go with him, and the next day they both left <hi>Paris:</hi> but after 2 days Journey <hi>Diomedes</hi> fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned himſelf very ſick and prayed <hi>Zenodor</hi> that he would be ſo kind as to fetch a Doctor, which he did.</p>
            <p>The Doctor came and feeling his Pulſe could not find any great matter of alteration; yet unwilling to declare that his opinion was ſo, leſt he ſhould miſs of ſuch a benefit, he orders him ſome gentle Medicines with a cordial Julep, and for that time leaves him to the care of <hi>Zenodor,</hi> withall telling him he muſt keep warm and uſe all means he could to get a litle ſweat.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Diomedes,</hi> appears ſtill worſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41556:140"/>
than before, and therefore willed <hi>Zenodor</hi> to take the Journey himſelf, deſcribing him to a hair the place where he ſhould delve for the Treaſure, which <hi>Zenodor</hi> taking for a great mark of Friendſhip and Fidelity made himſelf ready for the Journey. On the fourth day that they had ſtayed there, <hi>Zenodor</hi> ſetts forward betimes in the morning, with Inſtructions from <hi>Diomedes</hi> that if he could not find the place that he ſhould give him further directions afterwards by writing, and therefore appointed him a place where he ſhould take up his lodgings when there. So ſoon as he was ſet out, <hi>Diomedes</hi> diſpatches ſeveral Letters by Poſt to his Creditors at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to whom <hi>Zenodor</hi> was ingaged for him in great Sums, as alſo to ſome others whom <hi>Zenodor</hi> had helped him to rob, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them that at ſuch a time and place they ſhould find <hi>Zenodor,</hi> who had by him a conſiderable Sum of Money.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> received thoſe Letters, they ſtrove who ſhould be there firſt, without giving notice to one another, for that they ſuppoſed he had ſo much Money about him: and coming there nearly about one time they apprehended and tranſported him to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he was very fairly committed to Priſon, there to abide and expect his Trial. <hi>Zenodor</hi> was hereat mainly ſurprized, but more
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41556:141"/>
vexed at the treacherous dealings of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> for the Letters he had written were ſhown him.</p>
            <p>After 21 days was a Goal-delivery, and <hi>Zenodors</hi> Caſe laid open before the <hi>Schepens,</hi> where not only a long Indictment was brought againſt him, of many enormous Cheats, but alſo houſe-breaking and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencies of a higher nature, which being ſo clear and hainous were adjudged worthy of Death: whereof he received Sentence and was executed upon the Scaffold, where the Executioner lay his head before his Feet.</p>
            <p>However we muſt mind you that before the Sentence was pronounced they urged him to a candid Confeſſion of all he had done, and willed him to detect his Accomplices: which he (in hopes that the Bench would ſhow him ſome mercy) did: and amongſt the reſt <hi>de la Grange,</hi> who during his noble houſe-keeping acted for Steward. The ſame <hi>de la Grange,</hi> as he told them was frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly at the Houſe of one <hi>Ioffr.</hi> P—a notable Bawd near the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, upon the <hi>Cingle,</hi> which was a Rendezvous for a Gang of Raſcallity; that lived meerly upon Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Theft and other Villany. Upon theſe directions the Subſtitute <hi>Schout</hi> was ſent the next morning by 3 of the Clock, where he by an order from the full Benche broke open
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41556:141"/>
the Doors and found <hi>de la Grange</hi> and 5 <hi>Iews,</hi> each in bed with a Whore. The <hi>Iews</hi> who are in ſuch caſes according to a ſpecial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to that end provided are carried to Goal and left to the Rigour of the Law. The Mock Steward was alſo ſerved the like, and about 2 Moneths after received his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which was to be whipt upon the Scaffold, cauteriſed with a hot Iron in the ſhoulder and put into the Raſp-houſe, there to remain 8 years, altho not long after he broke out, but for a Murther committed upon a <hi>Hamburger,</hi> was brought to Goal and ſhortly after beheaded with the Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> who ſtaid no longer at that place than that night he ſent away the Letters for <hi>Holland,</hi> ran away under a colour of going to take the air, without paying his Hoſt; betaking himſelf directly for <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being arrived here he was at a great ſtrait, what courſe to take in hand to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf with money, ſeeing himſelf now for want of that brought to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme point. All that ever he could invent or think upon was to litle purpoſe, for he could not ſee any mean honeſt, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, to redreſs his decaying ſtate. He rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated all his Pockets to ſee if there were any of thoſe Golden Reliques left, may the very lining of his Breeches. In this deſolate Condition he wandred up and down the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41556:142"/>
ſtreets ready to ſtarve for want of relief, that finally he was fain to ſell his Cloaths and purchaſe an old patched Suit, in which he could with more confidence aſk an Alms.</p>
            <p>It happened upon a time that coming to a Houſe where they ſold very rich Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and ſeeing none in the ſhop, made bold to enter in, thinking that if any chanced in the mean while to come forth to beg relief, but when he ſaw that none came down, he aſſumed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>lift</hi> a very rich Cravat, of <hi>Point di Veneza</hi> which he cunningly drew up his ſleeve and ſo marched off with his purchaſe that he had bought without bargaining, and paid for without Money: which he ſoon found a Chapman for, ſelling it for 90. Livers, which was not half the value.</p>
            <p>Having received the Money he went to a Salesman to buy him a new Suit, and by the way met with a great croud of People, who were looking upon a Fiſt-duel between two fellows in Peſants habit, which when over, he ſpeeds him away to Market where coming, to a ſhop he looked him out a Suit amounting to the value of 60 <hi>gl.</hi> which having drawn on, and found it fitted him to a hair he began to look for Money in his old Breeches; but much miſtaken for ſome of the <hi>Horn-thumb</hi> Gang had done
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41556:142"/>
that Office for him. Our decayd Merchant feeling no bottom in his Pocket was in a main conſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Diomedes on the Contrary in hopes of new Rigging, was fain to draw on his old Robes again and depart, and glad that he made his eſcape ſo.</p>
            <p>With a ſorrowfull and deſperate heart he betook himſelf without the Town, where ſitting down humbly upon the Graſs, by the way ſide he fell to his old Trade again.</p>
            <p>After he had fitten here 2 or 3 days, came a poor Woman, who ſeeing a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage of her Calibre, ſtept towards him, entring into diſcours together, ſhe deſired him to inform her of the Guiſe of begging about <hi>Paris. Diomedes</hi> thus unexpectedly meeting with a Female of his own trade, with a rayment of divers colours, ſtockings turn'd over the ſhoes, hair looſe about her head, her face ſcorched with the ſun, never a ſhift to her back, and in ſhort all foul and naſty, yet well proportioned of Body, he ſtood ſtaring, thinking he had elſe where ſeen her, for both by her Voyce and Countenance, aſwell as her Language,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41556:143"/>
being ſomething guilty of the <hi>Nether dutch</hi> Idiom and Proſodie, he was certain that ſhe was an <hi>Amſterdammer,</hi> and after a ſerious view deſcried the very features of his dear <hi>Fernelia;</hi> on whom not withſtanding, her unworthineſs in times paſt, he had hearty Compaſſion, ſeeing her in ſuch a low condition. Longer could he not conceal himſelf, but as a fire that burns inwardly ſeeks a Vent and to burſt out, ſo the eager affections of that cloſe, tho unhappy union, would not endure to be ſmothered. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he kept himſelf ſom what ſtrange, altered his voice, and made her ſuch wary anſwers as ſhe could not perceive who he was, till ſuch times as himſelf liſted to detect it. He inquired further after her Life, Parentage, State and Fortune, which ſhe punctually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, yet with that obſcurity and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reſervation that had he not known the matter before hand, ſhould have gathered very litle from the rehearſal ſhe made of her Courſe of Life: but in the mids of this Diſcourſe, ſhe obſerved tears run down his cheeks and his ejes full, called to mind his Phyſnomy and upon her challenging him he altered his voice again being no longer able to reſtrain himſelf, which confirmed the matter.</p>
            <p>Upon this they embraced each other, and ſhe acknowledged him for her huſband:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41556:143"/>
as he alſo owned her for his wife, reſolving for the future to be partakers of one For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and be ſharers in what Providence ſhould allott them. <hi>Diomedes</hi> began to enquire of her, how ſhe came into that calamitous condition, which we ſhall impart to the Reader in a few words, and ſhow how that Vertue promotes a Save to the Dignity of a Lord, when on the contrary Vice reduces thoſe that are advanced to the high eſt pitch of Fortune to the loweſt degree, and vileſt condition fatal to Men.</p>
            <p>
               <q>After I had been, <hi>quoth ſhe,</hi> raiſed to ſuch a Condition and to that Eſtate by your means I verily beleeved it impoſſible for me ever to fall to the State wherein I now am; and as thoſe who by Money could command all that their Heart luſted, ſo I who was not bark-bound for that, was loath to deny my ſelf of any thing that might indulge my ſenſes, and not only contented herewith I ſought further to pamper my ſelf with what was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and by conſequence violated my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed (as is not unknwn to you) but ſeeing how that it was not ſafe for me to make any delay at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for fear of being taken notice of by Juſtice, and how that I was manifeſtly going to decay, I reſolved to make Sale of all I could in your abſence and run away with my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramour.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41556:144"/>
But being come into Flanders ſome words happened to riſe between, us which (as I beleeved) were by him created on purpoſe, for being upon the way &amp; far from any Village he tied me to a tree, ſtript me naked and took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Gold I had with him, &amp; leaving me there to ſhift for my ſelf ſince which time I could never hear of him. After I had lay here more than 50 hours not knowing whether Hunger or Cold ſhould be the greateſt cauſe to bring me to my end, I happened to hear ſome people in the Woods by night, and calling out they came and releaſed me, but not without forcing me to their wills. Being thus ſet at Liberty I wandred many days through the deſerts not daring by reaſon of my nakedneſs appear at any houſe, or ſpeak to any body that I ſaw: my Lodging was among Cattel upon the cold ground, and my Diet what I could find upon Trees, but being now in deſpair of ever coming to my former health, or recovering my ſtrength again, I lay down with an intent to dy and to endeavor no longer to keep my ſoul and body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Lying in this condition more likely to feed Wolves than Worms, came a brace of Hounds in purſuit of a Hare, which having loſt and finding me they began to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41556:144"/>
howl out, and would not leave me till the Huntsman himſelf came, who ſeeing a naked Woman was ſtrangely altered at the matter, and having compaſſion on me began to enquire how I came there in that deplorable condition, but through faintneſs I could hardly make him any anſwer, only I deſired him to trouble me no more, but ſuffer me to take my leave of the World which had ever been a burthen to me: but he not willing to ſee me periſh went to ſome Cottage not far from thence where he fetched me a few old cloaths which he threw about my body, but when he would have raiſed me, found I could not ſtand upright upon my leggs, but was fain to ſet me upon his horſe and hold me up, bringing me in that manner to his own houſe, where he ſet me by the Fire, and gave me warm Diet till I began to recover my ſtrength. Nor did the kindneſs of that <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> ſtop here and appear only in that, but being himſelf a man of mean condition and ſlender Fortune, he went to his Lord and other Gentlemen round about in the Countrey, who ſent me both Money and Habit, beſides many daily Viſits that they made and comforted me. When I was well recovered and a litle hearty, I took my leave of them all reſpectively, going
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41556:145"/>
to their houſes and thanking them for their great Bounty and Charity, but more eſpecially the Honeſt Huntsman. One of the Gentlewomen who had been the moſt liberal of the reſt at my departure gave me 2 Pieces of Gold with a Letter to a Perſon of Quality at <hi>Paris,</hi> deſiring them to admitt of me into their houſhold: but ſuch was my unhappineſs that going over a Bridge I was met with a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Soldiery, which I took for Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, theſe after they had miſerably plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered raviſhed me by turns. The greateſt favour they were pleaſed to ſhow me was reſtoring me the Letter which I was to bring to <hi>Paris,</hi> for that they knew it was not ſerviceable to them: altho when I was arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> that for the honor of the Lady in the Countrey I durſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it, ſince I was ſo meanly apparreled, ſo that in concluſion I was forced to take this trade of begging upon me, in which condition I have continued ever ſince, but find, alas! Charity is faint and cool, and envy as vigorous and hot among thoſe of our Fortunes and profeſſion,</q>
            </p>
            <p>More ſhe would have ſaid, but ſorrow preſſing too hard upon her heart put a ſtop to her proceeding in that Narrativ: and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> on the contrary deſiring her to relate no more, for that it wounded him to the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41556:145"/>
Heart. The Tears that ran trickling down her Cheeks he wiped with a lap of his ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered weed, and aſked her if ſhe would be partaker of what he had to eat, which was a cruſt of mouldy Bread and a cruſe of Spring-Water, that ſhe thankfully accepted, and ſat down by him.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as Table was over, they fell into a Study what practiſe to follow to get into a faſhionable way of living again; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting to rip up their former ſplendor, which was a greater grief to think upon, than their preſent calamity and deſpair. In ſhort they did not approv of this courſe of Life, for calling to mind their former ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Fortune, they reſolved to attempt higher things, and ſince <hi>Paris</hi> was a City well peopled, and conſequently the beſt place for their turn, they betook themſelves thither, where being arrived watched for their prey like the greedy Vultures, but finding nothing that they could lift in 3 or 4 days time, <hi>Diomedes</hi> bethinks himſelf of a new Machine, and calling <hi>Fernelia</hi> aſks her if ſhe had not the Letter which was given her by the Lady in the Countrey with her; ſhe anſwered, Yea. <hi>Diomedes</hi> therefore willed her to dreſs her ſelf in the beſt wiſe ſhe could and apply her ſelf thither not knowing what Providence may allot them, ſince they were now put to their laſt ſhift.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41556:146"/>
               <hi>Fernelia</hi> was very unwilling to do it, ſince ſhe was in ſuch mean apparrel, and might rather be looked upon as a Cheat, eſpecially the Letter being of an old date, and if it were either tranſcribed or altered that the matter would ſmell the worſe, the more if the Lady who delivered her the Letter ſhould ſince have been at <hi>Paris. As to the firſt thing</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Diomedes) you ſcruple at, there will be no great difficulty in it, the rather for that you have a juſt excuſe conſiſtent with Truth, which will rather be an advantage than a let to your purpoſe: but if in caſe the Lady has bin in Town ſince the date of this Letter, without Doubt, ſhe will have diſcourſed the matter, and, as it were, broke the Ice before you, and given her an account of your former misfortune, which will the more induce them to beleeve what has ſince verily befallen you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons moved her to hazard the matter and dreſſing her ſelf in the beſt wiſe ſhe could, waits her opportunity to deliver the Letters but was not ſuffered Admittance till ſhe told one of the Pages that ſhe had a Letter for his Lady, which ſhe deſired him to deliver. The Page receives the Letter and forthwith reached it over to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Uſher who gave it the Lady. So ſoon as <hi>Madame de Oquendo</hi> had read the Letter (for ſo was her name) ſhe ſent for <hi>Fernelia</hi> and for an hour or two diſcourſed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41556:146"/>
her about circumſtances, fearing whether that it was the real hand-writing of the Lady, her Couſin. In ſhort ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her to come after 8 days and ſhe would her ſelf in the mean time conſider how to diſpoſe of her, and with that left her and went into the Hall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fernelia</hi> finding here ſuch good encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement watched her opportunity, and after 8 days went to wait upon the Lady, who by that time had received a Letter from the Countrey, which happily confirm'd the other <hi>Fernelia</hi> delivered. <hi>Madame d'Oquendo,</hi> whoſe huſband was a Spaniard, and ſhe now and then a litle poſſeſſed with Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, was hardly willing to take her into the houſe, for that, as we have already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Fernelia</hi> was a Woman of a ſingular form. She nevertheleſs ordered her to ſtay there ſo long till ſhe ſhould hear of ſome other place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fernelia</hi> thus admitted into the houſhold, got into good apparel and fed at a plentifull Table, began to look as lofty as ever, often wiſhing that ſhe might but be rid of her Huſband who came now and then to ſpeak with her.</p>
            <p>About 14 days after came another Letter from the Lady in the Countrey, which further confirmed that there was ſuch a Letter ſent by an indigent Perſon, and in all things agreeable
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41556:147"/>
to what the other ſpecified, ſo that the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Lady being now out of ſuſpence as to the verity of the matter, uſed <hi>Fernelia</hi> very civilly and promoted her from the common rank of Servants, to the Quality of a Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gentlewoman, and at laſt committed to her care all the Houſe and Family.</p>
            <p>Being thus on a ſudden advanced, and of ſuch repute in the ſight of all the whole houſe, the Lady ſeldom ever troubled her ſelf with the diſpoſal of any thing, but left the management of the Market to <hi>Fernelia,</hi> who ever now and then imbezled ſomething for her Darling, which ſhe privatly ſent him with a charge never to come anigh the houſe, for fear of ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> willingly abſents himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all his heart deſired, but very impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to play ſo long at ſmall Games urges her often times by writing to make a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpatch, which ſhe nevertheleſs would in no caſe aſſent to, till forced to it by his frequent importunity, and perſonal viſits which at laſt he preſumed to make, which hatched a terrible miſchief, and, <hi>that Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that had gone ſo often to the Well, came home broke at laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was about the preparation againſt Lent, at what time ſome Noblemen of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, among other ſuperſtitious Rites, do uſually hang their Private Chappels and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41556:147"/>
Altars with Purple, covering all the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes and Images with the ſame, ſo that <hi>Fernelia</hi> profeſſing ſkill in thoſe things, was ordered to buy ſo much as they ſhould have occaſion for in the Chappel.</p>
            <p>Which when done, all was hung and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, ſave only two Windows; but coming too ſhort, the Lady was not willing to buy any more, but taxed the Man that hung the Altar for being too profuſe, and not obſerving that what they had bought ſhould ſerve their turn. The man when thus chidden made anſwer that he had but made uſe of ſo many ells, and would have meted it in her preſence: ſo that he clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that the fault lay not in him, upon which the Lady in perſon went to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to inquire whether they had any more of the ſame: The Mercer replyed, that they had no more, nor that none in <hi>Paris</hi> had any ſuch in 10 years: In ſhort the Lady came to underſtand that <hi>Fernelia</hi> had bought ſo many Ells more than the man had uſed, ſo that the fault muſt needs ly in one of them three; either <hi>Fernelia,</hi> the Mercer, or the Upholſterer. However the Lady put all up in quietneſs and made no more talk of it, till <hi>Diomedes</hi> came according to his uſual cuſtome to pay his dear <hi>Fernelia</hi> a viſit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a new ſuit with a Veſt and Lining of the very ſame Purple, whence ſhe began
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41556:148"/>
to ſuſpect that <hi>Fernelia</hi> had embezled the Goods, and therefore imparted the matter to her ſiſter at that time in the houſe with her. <hi>Fernelia</hi> hearing them often whiſper, and by ſome other circumſtances gathered that they had her in ſuſpicion, reſolved before 2 days were at an end to march off, and therefore gave <hi>Diomedes</hi> notice of it, who the next evening came to give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fernelia</hi> packs up as much Plate and Jewels as ſhe could very well come at, altho the latter ſhe could not ſo eaſily come by, it being Lent, and a time when the <hi>Pariſians</hi> appear with leſs ſplendour abroad than at other times. With this ſhe ſteals clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinly out at a back-door where ſhe meets with <hi>Diomedes,</hi> who eaſed her of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, both marching on a good pace till they thought that they were out of harms way.</p>
            <p>A great Ingratitude! but afterwards as well rewarded by the ſeverity of Juſtice, as you ſhall ſhortly hear.</p>
            <p>The Plate they converted into Money as ſoon as they could, till fearing that the Goldſmiths might have Tickets to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them: ſo that what remained <hi>Diomedes</hi> melted, intending to ſell it afterward when they had occaſion for Money.</p>
            <p>So long as this Money laſted they made
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41556:148"/>
good cheer, not ſparing for any thing that might add to their delight but drawing towards the laſt mite, they bethought themſelves of ſome other courſe to take in hand, whileſt they had ſome Moneys at command.</p>
            <p>It happened that pretty early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came to a Watchmaker, not far from the <hi>Louvre,</hi> who was very buſy in hanging out his watches, having lay them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed order. He prays that Watch-maker to read him a Letter, pretending that he could not make any ſence of it, which the Watch-maker did not once refuſe, but read and expounded it to him on the beſt wiſe he could. <hi>Fernelia</hi> in the mean while drew back her Arm and took up two Gold Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>very clandeſtinly, <hi>Diomedes</hi> alſo ſeeing one very richly enammeled made a ſhift to lift it without being taken notice of by the Watch-maker. But it ſeemed that a youth who ſat behind at work ſeeing that, ſo ſoon as they were gone told his Maſter of it. The Watchmaker in all haſt follows and ſiezes them, <hi>Diomedes</hi> would have ſtoutly denied the matter, but <hi>Fernelia</hi> was ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that he confeſſed the crime, reſtored him the Watches and begged forgiveneſs of him. It is true, the Watchmaker would have done it, but having made a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency of People together, he feared to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41556:149"/>
be called in queſtion for it, ſaid, he could not anſwer it if he did. While they diſputed the caſe came an Officer of Juſtice who after a litle enquity what there was to do, took <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Fernelia,</hi> and hurried them both to priſon, where they were to remain till the next Goal-Delivery.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of their Money was now ſpeedily brought to a Cataſtroph, and being unacquainted with the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they were in great diſtreſs, fearing that they ſhould at that time take their leave of the World, but,</p>
            <p>The Day for the Seſſions appointed being come they were brought to Trial and ſince there was no evident token that they had before been convict of any other crime, the Bench was not ſo rigorous. The Sentence was to be whipt and ſeared in the ſhoulder with a hot Iron, and afterward Baniſhed.</p>
            <p>In this condition they were ledout at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſet their courſe to wards <hi>Biſcay,</hi> where finding charity very cold by the way they reſolved to hazard another riſque. For paſſing by a fair houſe in the Countrey, they applied themſelves to the Maſter, deſiring to have a nights Lodging in the Barn or Stable, which was granted them. About midnight, they roſe up when they ſuppoſed all to be ſecure and aſleep, and lighting a Candle which they had in a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41556:149"/>
dark Lanthom, took out the Caſement and ſo got into the houſe, where they found a Cabinet in which was ſix Silver plates, and 3 dozen of Spoons, beſides a Saltſeller and 2 Porrengers, all of the ſame mettal, which they tooke away and marched out ſoftly, tending towards <hi>Bilboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as they were arrived there, they converted all into Money, thinking to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque themſelves for <hi>England,</hi> and there to ſpend the reſt of their Days, but as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>When Knaves fall out, Honeſt men get their own. Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Fernelia,</hi> fell into a hot conteſt, about I know not what trifile, ſo that words between them grew exceeding high, and <hi>Fernelia</hi> was ſo vexed that ſhe reſolved to ſend him to the Gallows, and make her ſelf miſtreſs of the Money; purſuant to which intent ſhe went to one whom ſhe intreated to aſſiſt her under the promiſe of a great reward. The Ruffian, who was a Perſon ever ready to do ſuch a Turn, promiſed her that he would not fail to do his endeavour.</p>
            <p>That night they conſulted to leave <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> aſleep, and having firſt taken all the Money, they paid the Hoſteſs, and ſent a Letter privately to the Praetor of theCity who immediately went to apprehend him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Diomedes</hi> found how caſes ſtood, that <hi>Fernelia</hi> had betray'd him, and was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41556:150"/>
march'd off with the Money, he gave notice of it to the Pretor, who thereupon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched ſome Perſons with a <hi>Pouvoir</hi> to take her and bring her back to <hi>Bilbao.</hi> The Ships were alſo viſited, and the high ways traced; till at laſt ſhe was found in the houſe of a poor Peſant, not far from the City, where ſhe had ſtay'd 2 nights, was brought to <hi>Bilbao,</hi> and there committed to ſafe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody.</p>
            <p>During the time of his Impriſonment came <hi>Mordechai</hi> the Jew to <hi>Bilbao,</hi> whom he had cheated of a conſiderable Sum of Money, as was mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 72. who hearing that a <hi>Hollander</hi> was committed to priſon, out of pure compaſſion went to viſit him; but ſeeing that it was <hi>Diomedes</hi> inſtead of giving him comfort, aggravated the matter, and threatned to bring in his Action againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lebechea</hi> ſeeing the Jew in earneſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his keeper, when he was gone, that ſuch an one, and a Jew was there in the City, requiring him to acquaint the Gentlemen of the Inquiſition with it, which the Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per not daring to conceal, immediatly went and detected him, upon which he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, examined, convicted of Judaiſm, and burn'd at the ſtake.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Diomedes</hi> had been about 5 weeks n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Fernelia</hi> were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seat of Juſtice, where the Judge firſt with an auſtere countenance threatned to put them to the Rack, but afterwards with more blandiloquence willed them to make a hearty Confeſſion, which without many Arguments they did, and ſo received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Diomedes</hi> to be hang'd and <hi>Fernelia</hi> whipt.
